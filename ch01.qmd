# Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and High-Fidelity Variant Calling

## The Challenge of NGS Data

- NGS generates billions of error-prone, short reads, making the accurate identification of genetic variants challenging.  
- Traditional methods like GATK rely on hand-crafted statistical models (e.g., hidden Markov models, logistic regression) that are difficult to generalize across different sequencing technologies.

## DeepVariant: Deep Learning for Variant Calling (Poplin et al., 2018)

- **Concept**: DeepVariant replaces the assortment of statistical modeling components with a single deep learning model.
- **Architecture**:
  - Uses a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), such as the Inception architecture.
  - Processes read pileups encoded as images around candidate variants.
  - The CNN learns complex dependencies among reads, approximating the true but unknown interdependent likelihood function.
- **Clinical Impact**:
  - DeepVariant demonstrated higher accuracy than state-of-the-art tools like GATK.
  - In clinical Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) trio analysis, DeepVariant yielded a significantly lower Mendelian error rate and shorter execution time compared to GATK HaplotypeCaller, suggesting proportionally more true positive calls.
