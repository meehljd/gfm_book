# Specialized Prediction – Splicing (SpliceAI)

## The Importance of Splicing

- Aberrant splicing is a major cause of genetic disorders.
- Specialized tools are necessary to interpret variants affecting this process.

## SpliceAI (Jaganathan et al., 2019)

- Uses an ultra-deep residual neural network architecture.
- Predicts splice junctions based on a large flanking context sequence (up to 10,000 nucleotides).

## Clinical Impact

- Accurately predicts noncoding cryptic splice mutations.
- Approx. 9%–11% of pathogenic mutations in patients with rare genetic disorders are caused by this class of variation.
- The network is trained only on reference sequences; predicting variant effects by comparing reference and alternate sequences (Δ score) is a robust test of its splicing determinant modeling ability.
