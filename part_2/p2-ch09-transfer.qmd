# Transfer and Adaptation {#sec-ch09-transfer}

**Transfer learning** fails as often as it succeeds, and the failures are silent. A protein language model trained on human sequences may confidently score variants in mouse orthologs, producing predictions that look reasonable but reflect human-specific evolutionary pressures irrelevant to mouse biology. A foundation model pretrained on coding sequences may extract features actively misleading for noncoding regulatory elements. A classifier achieving 90% accuracy on common variants may collapse to chance performance on the rare variants that matter most clinically. Nothing in the model's outputs signals these failures. The predictions look the same whether transfer has succeeded or catastrophically failed. This asymmetry between confident outputs and actual reliability creates the central methodological challenge of applying pretrained models: detecting when transfer works and when it does not, before the predictions reach clinical applications where failures have consequences.

The promise of transfer learning is substantial. Foundation models trained on billions of evolutionary sequences learn representations that capture protein structure, functional constraints, and sequence grammar without task-specific supervision (see @sec-ch08-pretraining). When these representations are applied to downstream tasks with limited labeled data, they can achieve performance that would be impossible for models trained from scratch. A variant effect predictor fine-tuned from *ESM-2* can classify novel missense mutations using patterns learned from the entire protein universe, not just the handful of variants with clinical annotations. This capacity to generalize from abundant unlabeled data to rare clinical scenarios has driven much of the enthusiasm for genomic foundation models.

The reality requires careful navigation. Every adaptation decision involves tradeoffs: preserving pretrained knowledge versus enabling task-specific learning, computational efficiency versus model flexibility, rapid deployment versus careful validation. Full **fine-tuning** updates all parameters, risking catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Feature extraction freezes all pretrained parameters, limiting adaptation to task-specific patterns. Parameter-efficient methods (adapters, LoRA, prompt tuning) navigate between these extremes, but each makes different assumptions about where adaptation should occur.

## Source and Target Domains {#sec-ch09-source-target}

When a cardiologist requests variant interpretation for a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the clinical need (classifying a specific *MYH7* variant) differs fundamentally from the data available during model development (millions of protein sequences sampled across all of evolution). Bridging this gap requires understanding what properties of pretraining determine whether transfer will succeed. When this bridge fails, patients receive confident predictions based on patterns irrelevant to their clinical context.

### Gap Between Pretraining and Deployment {#sec-ch09-pretraining-deployment-gap}

The **source domain** encompasses the data and objectives used during pretraining. For DNA foundation models, source domains typically include reference genomes, pan-genomic collections spanning population diversity, or metagenomic assemblies sampling environmental sequence space [@ji_dnabert_2021; @dalla-torre_nucleotide_2023]. For protein models, databases like UniRef provide billions of sequences representing the diversity of evolutionary history [@suzek_uniref_2007]. Pretraining objectives (masked language modeling, next-token prediction, contrastive learning) encourage models to capture statistical regularities that help predict held-out tokens: local motifs, compositional patterns, and the signatures distinguishing functional from random sequence (see @sec-ch08-pretraining for detailed treatment of these objectives). These learned regularities become the representations that might transfer to downstream tasks.

The **target domain** presents a fundamentally different challenge. Rather than abundant unlabeled sequence, the target domain offers sparse labeled examples of a specific clinical or biological question: a few thousand enhancer sequences with luciferase measurements, several hundred variants with expert pathogenicity classifications, chromatin profiles across a handful of disease-relevant cell types. The target distribution often looks nothing like pretraining data. Pathogenic variants are rare outliers, not typical protein sequences. Tissue-specific enhancers exhibit patterns that genome-wide pretraining may never emphasize. Disease-associated regulatory elements may have been systematically underrepresented in reference data [@kircher_general_2014].

Four factors determine whether this distributional gap can be bridged. Task relatedness measures whether target predictions depend on patterns the model learned during pretraining; predicting transcription factor binding after sequence pretraining succeeds because both involve local motif recognition, while predicting three-dimensional chromatin contacts may require spatial relationships the pretraining objective never captured. Target data quantity constrains which adaptation strategies avoid overfitting; with thousands of labeled examples, aggressive fine-tuning can reshape representations, but with dozens, only the lightest approaches remain viable. Model expressiveness influences adaptation flexibility, as larger models encode richer internal representations that can potentially serve more diverse downstream tasks but also risk memorizing small target datasets. Distribution overlap between source and target determines how much learned knowledge applies; human regulatory elements share patterns with mouse elements (enabling cross-species transfer) but diverge in species-specific enhancers (limiting it).

### Recognizing Transfer Outcomes {#sec-ch09-transfer-outcomes}

Not all transfer helps, and distinguishing outcomes requires explicit validation. **Positive transfer** accelerates learning or improves final performance beyond training from scratch. **Negative transfer** occurs when pretraining actively hurts, either because learned features conflict with task requirements or because pretrained initialization creates optimization difficulties [@wang_characterizing_2019]. Neutral transfer describes situations where pretraining neither helps nor hurts, wasting computational resources on pretrained models without benefit. When a pharmacogenomics team adapts a DNA language model for *CYP2D6* metabolizer status prediction, they must empirically verify which outcome applies to their specific task rather than assuming transfer will help because it helped elsewhere.


## Feature Extraction and Representation Analysis {#sec-ch09-feature-extraction}

Clinical laboratories processing hundreds of variants daily cannot afford to fine-tune models for each new gene or variant class. When a novel gene enters diagnostic panels, classifiers must be deployed rapidly using whatever labeled examples exist. A molecular diagnostics team with 200 annotated *RYR1* variants for malignant hyperthermia risk prediction cannot fine-tune a 500-million parameter model; they need an approach that works with minimal data while avoiding adaptation risk entirely.

Frozen feature extraction addresses this constraint by treating pretrained models as fixed representation engines. All backbone parameters remain frozen; only a lightweight classifier trained on the extracted representations learns from labeled data. The backbone never changes, eliminating catastrophic forgetting entirely and enabling deployment within hours rather than weeks. The fundamental tradeoff is clear: frozen features sacrifice adaptation flexibility for speed, safety, and efficiency.

### Linear Probing {#sec-ch09-linear-probing}

Why does the simplest possible classifier often suffice? If pretrained representations already encode task-relevant features in linearly separable form, adding complexity provides no benefit and risks overfitting. **Linear probing** tests this hypothesis by introducing only *d* × *c* parameters (where *d* is the embedding dimension and *c* is the number of output classes). Pass input sequences through the frozen model to obtain embeddings, typically from the final layer or from a designated [CLS] token aggregating sequence information, then train a linear classifier mapping embeddings to task labels.

Ji et al. demonstrated that *DNABERT* embeddings paired with linear probes achieve competitive chromatin accessibility prediction from a few hundred positive and negative examples, matching convolutional neural network baselines requiring far more labeled data [@ji_dnabert_2021]. Dalla-Torre et al. showed similar results with *Nucleotide Transformer*, where linear probes on frozen embeddings approached fine-tuned performance for promoter detection and splice site recognition [@dalla-torre_nucleotide_2023]. These successes reflect alignment between pretraining objectives (predicting masked tokens from local context) and target tasks (distinguishing sequences based on motif patterns the model already learned to recognize).

### When Linear Probing Fails {#sec-ch09-linear-probing-limits}

Linear probes fail when relevant information exists in embeddings but requires nonlinear transformation to extract. Shallow multilayer perceptrons (one or two hidden layers) extend linear probing by enabling more complex decision boundaries while maintaining computational efficiency. With several thousand labeled examples, shallow MLPs on *HyenaDNA* embeddings improve splice site prediction over linear probes by capturing interactions between features that linear models cannot represent [@nguyen_hyenadna_2023]. The additional expressiveness helps when task-relevant patterns are distributed across embedding dimensions in ways that linear combination cannot capture.

The more fundamental limitation cannot be addressed by classifier complexity: performance caps at how well pretrained representations already encode task-relevant features. If the pretraining objective emphasized patterns irrelevant to the downstream task, or if required features were actively suppressed during pretraining, frozen features will underperform models trained from scratch regardless of classifier sophistication. A model pretrained exclusively on coding sequence may encode features misleading for noncoding regulatory prediction; no linear probe can overcome representations that point in the wrong direction.

### Probing Representations {#sec-ch09-probing-representations}

A variant effect predictor built on *ESM* embeddings achieves 85% accuracy in initial testing, but the team deploying it needs to understand why. Does the model genuinely capture evolutionary constraint relevant to pathogenicity, or has it learned spurious correlations that will fail on out-of-distribution variants? Before committing computational resources to adaptation, practitioners benefit from understanding what the pretrained model actually learned.

**Probing classifiers** answer these diagnostic questions by systematically interrogating representations before deployment. The methodology converts the abstract question "will transfer help?" into concrete evidence about representation content: train lightweight classifiers to predict properties of interest from frozen embeddings, then examine how accurately different properties can be decoded. If chromatin accessibility can be predicted with 85% accuracy from a linear probe, the representations already encode accessibility-relevant features and frozen feature extraction will likely succeed. If transcription factor binding requires a deep nonlinear classifier to reach the same accuracy, relevant information exists but is not linearly separable, suggesting PEFT might help by reorganizing representations for easier extraction. If a property cannot be predicted above chance even with flexible classifiers, the representations may lack necessary information entirely, and transfer to this task may fail regardless of adaptation strategy.

### What Probing Reveals About Pretrained Models {#sec-ch09-probing-results}

Systematic probing reveals what models learn during pretraining. Rives et al. demonstrated that *ESM* protein embeddings encode secondary structure so thoroughly that linear probes achieve near state-of-the-art helix/sheet/coil prediction accuracy [@rives_biological_2021]. Contact prediction (which residues are spatially close in folded structure) requires nonlinear probes but still achieves strong performance, indicating that tertiary structure information is present but requires transformation to extract. DNA language models show similar patterns: local motif information is recoverable by linear probes while long-range dependencies require multi-layer networks [@ji_dnabert_2021].

Layer-wise probing reveals how information transforms through the model. Early layers typically encode local compositional features (*k*-mer frequencies, simple motifs, sequence statistics) while later layers capture more abstract patterns (regulatory signatures, evolutionary constraints, functional classifications) [@jawahar_what_2019]. For tasks depending on local features, representations from early or middle layers may outperform final-layer embeddings that have abstracted away relevant details. Layer selection becomes another hyperparameter to optimize during adaptation.

### Probing Guides Adaptation Strategy {#sec-ch09-probing-guides-adaptation}

The diagnostic value extends beyond predicting which adaptation strategy to use. When probing reveals that required features are absent from pretrained representations, practitioners face a choice: commit to full fine-tuning with sufficient target data (hoping the model can learn missing features), switch to a different foundation model whose pretraining objective better aligns with task requirements, or proceed with from-scratch training that does not inherit inappropriate inductive biases. The investment in probing before adaptation often saves months of wasted effort on transfer that was doomed from the start.


## Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning {#sec-ch09-peft}

A research hospital developing tissue-specific expression predictors faces an impossible choice. Frozen features from *Enformer* provide reasonable baselines, but full fine-tuning for each of fifty tissue types would require months of GPU time and risk overfitting the thousands of tissue-specific training examples. The team needs an intermediate approach: enough flexibility to improve over frozen features, enough constraint to prevent overfitting, enough efficiency to iterate across dozens of tissues.

**Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** methods resolve this tension by updating a small subset of parameters while keeping the majority frozen, enabling task-specific adaptation without the computational expense or overfitting risk of modifying all weights [@houlsby_parameter-efficient_2019]. The key insight is that useful adaptation often requires changing only a small subspace of model behavior, not rewriting everything the model learned during pretraining.

### Low-Rank Adaptation {#sec-ch09-lora}

**Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** has emerged as the dominant PEFT technique in genomic applications because it directly operationalizes this insight. Rather than updating a large weight matrix *W* directly, LoRA introduces two smaller matrices *A* and *B* whose product approximates the desired weight change: *W'* = *W* + *BA* [@hu_lora_2021]. During fine-tuning, *W* remains frozen while only *A* and *B* receive gradient updates. The rank of these matrices (typically 8 to 64 for genomic models) controls adaptation expressiveness: lower ranks introduce fewer parameters and stronger implicit regularization; higher ranks enable more flexible task-specific modification at greater overfitting risk.

The efficiency gains prove substantial. A transformer with 500 million parameters might require updating only 2 to 5 million LoRA parameters (representing the low-rank decompositions applied to attention weight matrices), reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared with full fine-tuning. This efficiency enables training on consumer GPUs for models that would otherwise require specialized infrastructure, and enables systematic hyperparameter search that would be prohibitive with full parameter updates. Zhou et al. demonstrated that LoRA adapters on *Nucleotide Transformer* enable tissue-specific chromatin accessibility prediction, where separate low-rank matrices capture tissue-specific regulatory patterns while the pretrained backbone encodes general sequence understanding [@zhou_dnabert-2_2024].

:::

### Configuring Low-Rank Adaptation {#sec-ch09-lora-config}

Selecting LoRA hyperparameters requires balancing expressiveness against overfitting risk, with optimal choices depending on task alignment and available data. The rank parameter controls how many dimensions of modification are possible. Ranks of 4 to 16 typically suffice for tasks closely aligned with pretraining objectives, where small perturbations to pretrained weights capture the required adaptation. When target tasks diverge more substantially from pretraining, ranks of 32 to 64 may prove necessary, though higher ranks approach the parameter count where full fine-tuning becomes competitive. Empirical comparison across ranks on held-out validation data remains the most reliable selection method; theoretical guidance for optimal rank given task characteristics does not yet exist.

The question of which layers to adapt depends critically on whether the foundation model uses encoder or decoder architecture. Encoder models like *DNABERT* and *Nucleotide Transformer* process entire sequences bidirectionally, building representations that integrate context from both directions at every layer. For these models, middle and later layers typically encode the most task-relevant features: early layers capture local sequence patterns (motifs, k-mer statistics) while deeper layers integrate these into higher-order representations (see @sec-ch08-pretraining for discussion of layer-wise representation learning). Adapting only the final third of transformer layers often achieves most of the performance gain at a fraction of the parameter cost. Linear probing experiments across layers can identify where task-relevant information concentrates before committing to adapter placement.

Decoder models like *HyenaDNA* in autoregressive mode and GPT-style genomic models present different considerations. These architectures process sequences left-to-right, with each position attending only to preceding context. The causal attention mask means that later layers have seen more integrated context, but the unidirectional flow creates different feature hierarchies than bidirectional encoders. For decoder models, adapting attention layers proves particularly important because the causal structure means attention patterns determine what contextual information flows forward. Practitioners often find that adapting both attention projections (queries, keys, values, and output) and feed-forward layers in decoder models yields better results than attention-only adaptation that works well for encoders.

Within layers, LoRA can be applied to query, key, value, and output projection matrices in attention, and to the two weight matrices in feed-forward blocks. Attention weight adaptation alone often suffices for encoder models on classification tasks, where the key adaptation involves changing what information the model attends to. Feed-forward adaptation becomes more important when the required transformation involves learning new feature combinations rather than reweighting existing attention patterns. When computational budget permits, adapting all weight matrices with lower rank often outperforms adapting fewer matrices with higher rank.

These heuristics provide starting points, not guarantees. The interaction between model architecture, pretraining objective, target task, and available data creates a combinatorial space that resists simple rules. Systematic hyperparameter search over rank, layer selection, and weight matrix targeting, guided by validation performance on data matching the deployment distribution, remains the most reliable path to effective adaptation.

## Full Fine-Tuning {#sec-ch09-full-finetuning}

When Avsec et al. sought to predict gene expression from sequence across hundreds of cell types, they required a model capturing tissue-specific regulatory logic unavailable from any generic pretrained representation [@avsec_enformer_2021]. With millions of labeled examples spanning thousands of genomic tracks, they could afford to update all model parameters, reshaping internal representations entirely for their specific predictive task. Constrained adaptation would have left tissue-specific regulatory patterns unlearned.

Full fine-tuning offers maximum flexibility: every parameter becomes tunable, enabling the model to learn whatever features the target task requires regardless of pretraining emphasis. This flexibility comes with risks proportional to its power.

### Making Full Fine-Tuning Work {#sec-ch09-full-finetuning-practice}

Full fine-tuning updates all model parameters during adaptation but requires careful attention to optimization dynamics. Learning rates must be substantially lower than during pretraining (often 10 to 100 times smaller) to avoid catastrophically disrupting learned representations in early training steps [@howard_universal_2018]. **Gradual unfreezing**, where top layers update first and deeper layers progressively join training, helps preserve low-level features (local motifs, basic sequence statistics) while allowing high-level task-specific adjustment. Regularization through weight decay, dropout, and early stopping on validation data prevents overfitting to target datasets.

The approach suits scenarios when labeled datasets are large (tens of thousands of examples or more), when the target task diverges substantially from pretraining such that constrained adaptation proves insufficient, or when performance requirements justify computational investment. *Enformer* fine-tuning for new chromatin assays requires updating most parameters to capture assay-specific signal characteristics distinct from original training conditions. Expression prediction across novel cell types benefits from full adaptation when sufficient tissue-specific data exists.

### Risks of Unconstrained Adaptation {#sec-ch09-finetuning-risks}

**Catastrophic forgetting** occurs when fine-tuning overwrites general knowledge useful for related tasks or out-of-distribution inputs; a model fine-tuned aggressively on lymphocyte data may lose performance on epithelial cells it previously handled well [@mccloskey_catastrophic_1989]. Overfitting afflicts small target datasets, where the model memorizes training examples rather than learning generalizable patterns. Computational expense can be prohibitive for models with billions of parameters. When negative transfer occurs (pretraining initialization actually hurts optimization), full fine-tuning may underperform training from scratch despite the additional expense.

The conservative strategy is to start with simpler methods and escalate only when they demonstrably fail. Establish frozen feature baselines first. If frozen features outperform random initialization, try PEFT methods before committing to full fine-tuning. Compare fine-tuned models against properly-tuned from-scratch baselines on the same target data. Monitor for overfitting through validation curves and early stopping. The goal is achieving required performance with minimal adaptation complexity.


## Choosing an Adaptation Strategy {#sec-ch09-choosing-strategy}

The preceding sections described what each adaptation approach does; here we address when to use each. Two factors dominate the decision: how much labeled data exists, and how closely the target task aligns with pretraining objectives. @fig-adaptation-decision-tree provides a decision framework, but the underlying logic is straightforward.

Data quantity determines what is possible. With fewer than 500 labeled examples, linear probing represents the only viable approach; more complex adaptation overfits catastrophically. Between 500 and 5,000 examples, PEFT methods offer favorable tradeoffs, introducing enough flexibility to improve over frozen features while maintaining implicit regularization. Above 10,000 examples, full fine-tuning becomes viable and may be necessary when target tasks diverge substantially from pretraining. Task similarity determines what is necessary. When targets closely resemble pretraining patterns (predicting transcription factor binding after sequence pretraining), frozen features often suffice. When tasks diverge moderately (tissue-specific expression after genome-wide pretraining), PEFT enables selective adaptation. When tasks fundamentally differ from pretraining (three-dimensional chromatin contacts from sequence-only pretraining), full fine-tuning may be required to learn features the pretraining objective never emphasized. Computational constraints impose practical limits: linear probing requires minutes on CPUs, LoRA requires hours on single GPUs, and full fine-tuning of large models requires days on multiple GPUs.

These heuristics indicate which strategies merit trying first, but empirical validation supersedes any rule. No formula reliably predicts which approach will succeed for a specific combination of model, task, and data. The conservative path is to establish frozen feature baselines first, escalate to PEFT when frozen features prove insufficient, and reserve full fine-tuning for cases where simpler methods demonstrably fail and sufficient data exists to justify the risk.

## Domain Shift and Cross-Context Transfer {#sec-ch09-domain-shift}

The *CYP2D6* gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme metabolizing approximately 25% of clinically used drugs, including codeine (where poor metabolizers experience no analgesic effect) and tamoxifen (where poor metabolizers show reduced breast cancer treatment efficacy) [@gaedigk_pharmacogene_2018]. A foundation model trained on human genomic data and adapted for *CYP2D6* variant classification might achieve 90% accuracy on common variants well-represented in training data. But the variants most important clinically are rare: novel star alleles in underrepresented populations, structural variants creating gene duplications or deletions, population-specific haplotypes absent from reference databases. Domain shift between training and deployment distributions creates systematic blind spots precisely where clinical stakes are highest.

### Types of Domain Shift in Genomics {#sec-ch09-domain-shift-types}

Three types of **domain shift** commonly afflict genomic transfer learning, each creating different patterns of failure.

Evolutionary divergence creates the most fundamental barrier to cross-species transfer. When models trained on human sequences are applied to other organisms, differences in regulatory syntax, motif grammar, and functional constraints can undermine predictions entirely. Human-to-mouse regulatory prediction works reasonably for conserved housekeeping genes but fails for rodent-specific enhancers that never existed in the human training distribution. Strategies for cross-species success include pretraining on multi-species data to learn conservation patterns, fine-tuning with species-specific adapters, and focusing on highly conserved features (core promoter elements, splice site consensus sequences) that transfer more readily than species-specific innovations [@kelley_cross-species_2020].

Tissue-specific regulatory programs create equally severe challenges for cross-tissue transfer. Chromatin accessibility varies dramatically across tissues, with thousands of tissue-specific enhancers and repressors controlling cell-type identity. Models trained predominantly on one tissue may miss regulatory logic specific to others. Effective approaches include shared backbones with tissue-specific prediction heads (each head learns tissue-specific transformations of shared representations), tissue-conditional models accepting tissue identity as additional input, and meta-learning frameworks training across many tissues to extract general principles applicable to novel tissue types [@avsec_enformer_2021].

Differences in molecular readout technology create a more subtle form of shift that affects cross-assay transfer. ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq both measure chromatin state but with different biochemistry, resolution, and signal characteristics. Models trained on one assay may learn assay-specific artifacts rather than underlying biology, producing predictions that fail when applied to related assays measuring the same phenomenon differently. Multi-task pretraining across assays helps models distinguish biological signal from assay-specific noise.

### Detecting and Mitigating Shift {#sec-ch09-detecting-shift}

Detecting domain shift before deployment prevents silent clinical failures. Statistical divergence measures comparing source and target distributions quantify distribution differences. Embedding visualizations (t-SNE or UMAP projections) reveal whether target examples fall within the source distribution or occupy unfamiliar regions of representation space. Monitoring performance on canary examples (known easy cases that should always be predicted correctly) provides early warning of severe shift during deployment.

When domain shift is detected, mitigation strategies include domain-adaptive fine-tuning, importance weighting of training examples, and explicit modeling of shift through domain-adversarial training [@ganin_domain-adversarial_2016]. When shift is severe and cannot be mitigated, acknowledging that transfer is inappropriate for this context prevents overconfident deployment of models that will fail.

## Minimal-Data and Emerging Transfer Paradigms {#sec-ch09-minimal-data}

A geneticist studying a newly characterized neurodevelopmental disorder has identified 15 patients with variants in a previously unstudied gene. Functional studies confirm pathogenicity for 8 variants; the remaining 7 are benign. Training a classifier from 15 examples using standard supervised learning would be absurd, yet the clinical need for variant interpretation is immediate. Parents are waiting for diagnoses. **Few-shot learning** and **zero-shot learning** address these extreme data scarcity scenarios that characterize many genomic applications, where clinical urgency outpaces data availability.

### Few-Shot Learning with Minimal Examples {#sec-ch09-few-shot}

When only 10 to 100 examples per class exist, standard adaptation overfits catastrophically. The core insight of few-shot learning is that models can be trained explicitly for rapid adaptation by optimizing across many few-shot tasks during a meta-training phase [@finn_model-agnostic_2017]. **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** exemplifies this approach by finding parameter initializations that can be fine-tuned effectively from minimal data. The initialization represents a point in parameter space from which a few gradient steps reach good task-specific solutions. At deployment, the meta-trained model adapts to new tasks from a handful of labeled examples, having learned during meta-training what features are generally useful and how to adapt quickly.

A simpler alternative avoids gradient updates at deployment entirely. **Prototypical networks** learn to embed sequences such that examples from the same class cluster together [@snell_prototypical_2017]. At inference, class prototypes are computed as the mean embedding of the few available examples per class, and novel sequences are classified based on distance to prototypes. With 10 pathogenic and 10 benign variants as prototypes, novel variants are classified by which prototype cluster they fall nearest in embedding space. The approach requires no parameter updates during deployment, only forward passes to compute embeddings and distances.

### Zero-Shot Transfer Without Task-Specific Data {#sec-ch09-zero-shot}

The most extreme adaptation scenario eliminates task-specific examples entirely. Zero-shot transfer makes predictions using only the pretrained model's outputs, without any task-specific adaptation. For protein variant effect prediction, *ESM* log-likelihood ratios score variants by how much they reduce the model's probability of the observed sequence [@meier_esm-1v_2021]. Variants that violate the model's learned expectations for natural proteins (disrupting conserved residues, introducing destabilizing substitutions) receive low likelihood ratios, flagging them as potentially deleterious. This approach proves competitive with supervised methods for ClinVar pathogenicity prediction because evolutionary constraint (what masked language modeling learns to predict) correlates with functional importance (what pathogenicity classification measures).

Zero-shot methods require strong alignment between pretraining objectives and target tasks. When this alignment exists (evolutionary constraint predicts pathogenicity), zero-shot approaches provide immediate predictions without any labeled data. When alignment is weaker (tissue-specific regulatory activity depends on factors beyond sequence conservation), few-shot learning with even a handful of examples typically outperforms zero-shot baselines. For most practical genomic applications, some labeled data improves predictions; few-shot rather than true zero-shot represents the realistic minimal-data regime.

### Emerging Approaches {#sec-ch09-emerging-approaches}

Several paradigms are extending the boundaries of what minimal-data transfer can achieve. Very large language models exhibit the capacity for **in-context learning**, performing tasks by observing demonstrations rather than through explicit fine-tuning [@brown_language_2020]. Early evidence suggests genomic foundation models at sufficient scale may exhibit similar behavior, classifying variants based on a few pathogenic and benign examples included in the input prompt. This could transform deployment: rather than training adapters or fine-tuning parameters, practitioners would provide examples of desired behavior at inference time.

Adaptation need not be confined to training time. **Test-time adaptation** updates models during inference based on characteristics of test examples rather than freezing parameters after training [@wang_tent_2021]. For genomic applications facing distribution shift between development and deployment populations, test-time adaptation could adjust model behavior to match deployment-specific characteristics without requiring labeled examples from the deployment distribution. A model developed on European-ancestry data could adapt its uncertainty calibration when encountering African-ancestry variants that differ from training distributions.

Privacy constraints have motivated development of **federated transfer learning**, which enables collaborative model development across institutions without sharing raw genomic data [@rieke_future_2020]. Institutions train local models on private patient data and share only aggregated parameter updates, enabling foundation models to learn from far more diverse data than any single institution can access while preserving patient privacy. This approach could help address the population bias in current genomic datasets by enabling contributions from institutions serving underrepresented populations (see @sec-ch02-data for discussion of population representation in genomic databases).

### Toward Theoretical Foundations {#sec-ch09-theory}

Theoretical foundations for predicting transfer success based on measurable properties of source and target domains would reduce trial-and-error [@ben-david_theory_2010]. Currently practitioners must empirically test whether transfer helps; theoretical guidance specifying when transfer will succeed based on domain divergence measures, task similarity metrics, or representation analysis could focus effort on promising applications and avoid wasted investment in doomed transfer attempts.


## Diagnosing Transfer: Validation and Failure Modes {#sec-ch09-diagnosing-transfer}

The research team had done everything right. They selected a state-of-the-art DNA foundation model pretrained on diverse genomic sequences. They applied LoRA adaptation using 5,000 carefully curated training examples. Validation accuracy reached 88%. But when deployed on prospectively collected samples, performance collapsed to 62%, barely better than chance for a binary classification task. Transfer had failed. For the patients whose variants were misclassified during those weeks before the failure was detected, the consequences were real: delayed diagnoses, inappropriate treatments, unnecessary anxiety. Understanding why transfer fails prevents repeating the mistake.

### Diagnosing Negative Transfer {#sec-ch09-negative-transfer}

Negative transfer occurs when pretraining actively hurts performance, producing adapted models worse than those trained from scratch on target data alone. Pretraining on human coding sequences may encode codon usage patterns and amino acid preferences that create false expectations when applied to bacterial sequences with different GC content and codon bias. Pretraining on healthy tissue samples may learn features of normal cellular function that prove misleading for cancer samples where regulatory programs are fundamentally altered. The pretrained initialization, rather than providing a useful starting point, creates an optimization landscape that leads to poor task-specific solutions [@wang_characterizing_2019].

Diagnostic steps identify whether transfer helps or hurts. First, compare adapted model performance against a from-scratch baseline trained on identical target data with equivalent hyperparameter tuning; if the pretrained model does not meaningfully outperform from-scratch training, transfer provides no benefit and the computational overhead of working with large pretrained models is wasted. Second, establish that simpler adaptation strategies were tried before complex ones; if linear probing fails, full fine-tuning rarely succeeds unless target data is very large. Third, visualize embeddings from the pretrained model using dimensionality reduction; if target task classes are not separated in embedding space, pretrained representations may lack task-relevant features. Fourth, ablate pretraining entirely by comparing against randomly initialized models of identical architecture; this isolates whether pretrained weights provide value or whether architectural choices alone drive performance.

### Remediation When Transfer Fails {#sec-ch09-remediation}

When diagnostics reveal fundamental mismatches, several remediation strategies apply. Task-specific pretraining on data more closely aligned with target requirements can bridge the gap; pretraining specifically on regulatory regions for regulatory prediction tasks rather than genome-wide pretraining may produce more suitable representations. Hybrid architectures combining pretrained and randomly-initialized components allow selective use of transfer where it helps while avoiding its limitations elsewhere. Trying alternative foundation models whose pretraining objectives better match task requirements may reveal that the problem was model selection rather than transfer learning generally. And accepting that transfer provides no benefit for this specific task, proceeding with from-scratch training, remains a valid conclusion when evidence supports it.

### Validation and Common Pitfalls {#sec-ch09-validation-pitfalls}

A research group reports that their foundation model adaptation achieves 95% accuracy for splice variant classification, far exceeding previous methods. Six months later, clinical deployment reveals performance closer to 70%, with systematic failures on the rare variants that matter most. The initial evaluation was not wrong, but it was misleading. Proper validation separates genuine transfer success from evaluation artifacts that dissolve on contact with clinical reality (see @sec-ch20-benchmarks for expanded discussion of evaluation methodology).

### Sources of Spurious Success {#sec-ch09-spurious-success}

Test set overlap with pretraining data creates artificial performance inflation. Foundation models trained on massive genomic corpora may inadvertently include sequences later used for evaluation. When benchmarking on variants that appeared in pretraining data (even if unlabeled at pretraining time), the model has seen the sequences and may have memorized relevant patterns. Verifying that test sequences were excluded from pretraining requires careful provenance tracking, which published benchmarks often lack [@sainz_nlp_2023]. Chromosome-based splits help but do not fully address the problem when pretraining spans multiple species or includes population-level diversity (see @sec-ch22-confounding for detailed treatment of data leakage).

Temporal leakage uses future information unavailable at prediction time. Evaluating a variant pathogenicity model on variants annotated after training data was collected creates an unrealistically favorable setting; the model may have seen related variants or learned from the same evidence that later informed annotations. Temporal splits (training on variants discovered before a cutoff, evaluating on variants discovered afterward) provide more realistic assessment of prospective performance [@landrum_clinvar_2018].

Inappropriate baselines inflate apparent transfer benefits. Comparing adapted foundation models against weak or poorly-tuned from-scratch baselines makes transfer look more valuable than warranted. Strong baselines require equivalent hyperparameter tuning, appropriate architectures for the task, and sufficient training on the same target data. When properly-tuned CNNs match or exceed foundation model performance for a task, the additional complexity of pretrained models may not be justified.

### Evaluation Practices That Reveal True Performance {#sec-ch09-evaluation-practices}

Single-metric reporting obscures important performance characteristics. A model achieving 90% overall accuracy may show 95% accuracy on common variants and 50% accuracy on rare variants, with the clinically important rare cases hidden by aggregate metrics. Stratified evaluation by allele frequency, variant type, gene family, and other clinically relevant categories reveals whether transfer benefits generalize or concentrate in particular subgroups.

Confidence interval reporting and multiple training runs reveal performance variability. A single training run may produce misleadingly good or bad results through random initialization effects or data sampling. Testing on multiple independent datasets rather than a single benchmark reveals whether gains generalize beyond the specific evaluation setting.


## Case Studies in Transfer Learning {#sec-ch09-case-studies}

Transfer succeeds when pretraining objectives align with downstream requirements; it fails when they diverge. Four cases illustrate the conditions that distinguish success from failure.

### *DNABERT* for Chromatin Accessibility {#sec-ch09-case-dnabert}

Ji et al. pretrained *DNABERT* using masked language modeling on *k*-mer tokenized human genomic sequence [@ji_dnabert_2021]. For ATAC-seq peak classification, they applied linear probes to [CLS] token embeddings without updating backbone parameters. The approach achieved competitive performance with CNNs trained from scratch while requiring approximately 10 times less labeled data.

Success reflected strong alignment between pretraining and target task: both involve recognizing local sequence motifs (transcription factor binding sites, nucleosome positioning signals) that determine chromatin state. The pretrained representations already encoded the relevant patterns; the linear probe simply learned to separate accessible from inaccessible regions in this well-structured embedding space.

### *ESM* for Variant Pathogenicity {#sec-ch09-case-esm}

Rives et al. pretrained *ESM* on UniRef protein sequences using masked language modeling [@rives_biological_2021]. For ClinVar pathogenicity classification, Meier et al. showed that zero-shot scoring based on variant effects on sequence likelihood proved competitive with supervised methods [@meier_esm-1v_2021]. Adding a linear probe on *ESM* embeddings improved performance further, but the zero-shot baseline was already strong.

Success reflected implicit alignment: evolutionary constraint (what masked language modeling captures) correlates with functional importance (what pathogenicity measures). The pretraining objective, though never explicitly targeting variant classification, learned representations directly relevant to it.

### *Enformer* for Cross-Tissue Expression {#sec-ch09-case-enformer}

Avsec et al. pretrained *Enformer* on thousands of chromatin and expression tracks spanning dozens of cell types [@avsec_enformer_2021]. Fine-tuning with tissue-specific prediction heads for individual cell types captured regulatory logic unavailable from frozen features, outperforming both frozen *Enformer* and from-scratch models trained on individual tissues.

Success required both the large scale of pretraining (establishing general sequence-to-function mappings) and extensive fine-tuning data (enabling tissue-specific adaptation). With smaller fine-tuning datasets, the approach would have overfit; without diverse pretraining, the model would have lacked transferable regulatory knowledge.

### Cross-Species Regulatory Prediction {#sec-ch09-case-cross-species}

Models pretrained on human regulatory sequences and applied to zebrafish enhancer prediction often underperform zebrafish-specific models despite the apparent relevance of regulatory sequence patterns [@kelley_cross-species_2020]. The failure reflects both sequence divergence (zebrafish regulatory motifs differ from human) and lineage-specific regulatory innovations (teleost-specific enhancers have no human homologs from which to transfer).

The boundary between success and failure corresponds to evolutionary conservation: patterns shared across species transfer; species-specific patterns do not. Transfer succeeds for deeply conserved elements (core promoters, splice sites) but fails for lineage-specific regulatory logic.

## What Transfers, What Breaks {#sec-ch09-conclusion}

Transfer learning amplifies the value of pretrained models by connecting learned representations to specific applications. A foundation model pretrained on billions of sequences encodes patterns that would require orders of magnitude more labeled data to learn from scratch. Effective transfer realizes this investment; ineffective transfer inherits hidden limitations without the promised benefits.

The risks are concrete. Domain shift between pretraining and deployment contexts causes silent failures: models trained on research cohorts may miscalibrate on clinical populations, models trained on one species may fail unpredictably on another, models trained on one assay technology may not generalize to its successor. These failures produce confident predictions that are systematically wrong, often in ways that correlate with clinically relevant subgroups. Detection through distribution divergence measures and embedding visualization can identify shift before deployment, but mitigation requires either domain-adaptive fine-tuning or acceptance that some shifts cannot be bridged.

Validating transfer claims requires adversarial rigor. Test for contamination between pretraining and evaluation data through sequence-level deduplication. Implement temporal splits that respect real-world prediction scenarios. Compare against properly-tuned baselines trained from scratch with equivalent effort. Stratify performance by ancestry, variant type, and other clinically meaningful categories. The goal is establishing whether transfer provides genuine benefit under realistic deployment conditions, not optimizing for favorable benchmarks. Foundation model applications assume that transfer succeeds; the methods here determine whether that assumption holds for specific contexts.
