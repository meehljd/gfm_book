# Part IV: Systems and Scale {.unnumbered}

Biology operates across scales that sequence alone cannot capture. Cells of different types read the same genome differently, activating distinct gene programs that produce neurons, hepatocytes, and immune cells from identical DNA. Genes function not in isolation but within networks of regulation and interaction, where perturbing one node propagates effects throughout the system. The three-dimensional folding of chromatin brings distal elements into contact, creating regulatory logic invisible to models that treat genomes as one-dimensional strings. Sequence foundation models ask what a genome encodes; the models in this part ask what that sequence becomes in particular cellular contexts, interaction networks, and spatial architectures.

This transition from sequence-centric to systems-scale modeling demands new data modalities and new computational approaches. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals the cellular heterogeneity that bulk measurements average over. Hi-C and related methods expose the spatial organization that determines which enhancers contact which promoters. Protein interaction networks and gene regulatory graphs capture relational structure that no amount of sequence analysis can infer. Foundation model principles extend naturally to these modalities: learn representations from large-scale data, then transfer to specific prediction tasks.

Five chapters develop this theme. @sec-rna examines RNA structure and function, covering models that predict secondary structure, capture splicing regulation, and represent the emerging frontier of RNA foundation models. @sec-single-cell addresses foundation models for single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, showing how transformer architectures adapt to the sparsity, noise, and scale of single-cell data. @sec-3d-genome turns to three-dimensional genome organization, examining models that predict chromatin contacts from sequence, connect spatial structure to gene regulation, and extend to spatial transcriptomics methods that preserve tissue context. @sec-networks introduces graph neural networks that represent biological entities and their interactions as structured graphs, integrating foundation model embeddings with relational reasoning. @sec-multi-omics broadens the view to multi-omics integration, exploring how models jointly represent genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical information to trace the path from genotype to phenotype.
