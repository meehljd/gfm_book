## Mayo Clinic Scientific Press (Institutional Option)

### Mayo Clinic Scientific Press (via OUP)

**Overview:** Mayo's internal publishing arm, partnered with Oxford University Press. Primarily focused on clinical/medical content.

**URL:** https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/m/mayo-clinic-scientific-press-mayo/

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Relevant Series** | Mayo Clinic Scientific Press |
| **Prestige** | ★★★★☆ High in clinical circles; less ML recognition |
| **Fit** | ★★☆☆☆ Clinical focus; less computational |
| **Timeline** | ★★★☆☆ Likely standard OUP timeline |
| **Open Access** | ★★★☆☆ Via OUP infrastructure |
| **Distribution** | ★★★★☆ OUP distribution + Mayo network |
| **Support** | ★★★★☆ Institutional backing |

**Considerations:**
- **Pros:**
  - Institutional support and recognition
  - Built-in credentialing from Mayo affiliation
  - OUP production quality and distribution
  - Potential internal champions and expedited review
  - Clinical credibility for Part VII (Clinical Translation)

- **Cons:**
  - Series appears focused on clinical medicine, not computational methods
  - Existing titles are medical reference/practice-oriented
  - May not reach ML/computational biology audience effectively
  - Less recognition in computer science community

**Assessment:** The Mayo Clinic Scientific Press catalog appears to be primarily clinical practice guides, medical reference works, and patient-facing materials. Examples include radiology guides, cardiology texts, and clinical procedure manuals.

*Genomic Foundation Models* straddles clinical genomics AND deep learning methodology. The computational/ML depth may be outside MCSP's typical scope, though Part VII (Clinical Translation) aligns well with their clinical focus.

**Recommendation:**
- **Primary submission:** MIT Press or Cambridge (stronger ML recognition)
- **MCSP consideration:** If you have strong internal relationships or institutional pressure to publish through Mayo, MCSP could work - but negotiate to ensure computational biology audience reach
- **Alternative:** Could split content - extract clinical chapters (Part VII) for a MCSP-published clinical companion guide

**Questions to investigate:**
1. Has MCSP published computational/methods books before?
2. Who is the MCSP acquisitions contact?
3. Would Mayo institutional support (co-authorship, endorsement) strengthen a proposal to MIT/Cambridge?

## Tier 3: Specialized Publishers

### Morgan & Claypool (Synthesis Lectures)

**Overview:** Short-form monographs; part of ACM/IEEE ecosystem.

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Relevant Series** | Synthesis Lectures on Computational Biology |
| **Prestige** | ★★★☆☆ Good in technical circles |
| **Fit** | ★★☆☆☆ Length mismatch (they want 100-150 pages) |
| **Timeline** | ★★★★★ Fast (6-12 months) |
| **Open Access** | ★★★☆☆ Institutional subscription model |
| **Distribution** | ★★★☆☆ Digital-first |
| **Support** | ★★★☆☆ Streamlined |

**Issue:** Book is 339K words; Morgan & Claypool targets ~30K-50K per volume. Would need to be split into 6-8 volumes.

**Recommendation:** Not suitable for full manuscript; could extract focused monographs later

---

### Now Publishers (Foundations and Trends)

**Overview:** Long-form survey papers; influential in CS/ML.

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Relevant Series** | Foundations and Trends in Machine Learning |

## Recommended Submission Strategy

### Round 1 (Simultaneous)
1. **MIT Press** - Primary target
2. **Cambridge University Press** - Parallel submission

*Note: Verify both allow simultaneous submissions; if not, submit MIT first.*

### Round 2 (If Round 1 Declines)
3. **Oxford University Press**
4. **Springer Nature**

### Round 3 (Fallback)
5. **Self-publishing** via KDP/IngramSpark
6. **Leanpub** for digital distribution

### Parallel Track
- Maintain **open web version** regardless of publisher
- Negotiate open access clause with any traditional publisher
- Consider **Foundations and Trends** condensed survey as companion

---

## Open Access Negotiation Points

When discussing with traditional publishers, negotiate for:

1. **Green OA:** Right to post author accepted manuscript (AAM) after embargo
2. **Gold OA:** Publisher hosts open access version (may require fee)
3. **Preprint exception:** Right to maintain existing web version
4. **GitHub exception:** Right to keep code/notebooks open
5. **Derivative works:** Right to create course materials

**Key argument:** Web version drives awareness and adoption; print sales benefit from discovery.

## Publisher Contact Information

### MIT Press

**Relevant editors (contact in order):**

| Editor | Title | Areas | Fit |
|--------|-------|-------|-----|
| **Janice Audet** | Editorial Director | Trade Science, Biomedical Science | ★★★★★ Best fit |
| **Susan Hartman** | Senior Acquisitions Editor | Computer Science | ★★★★☆ ML angle |
| **Philip Laughlin** | Senior Acquisitions Editor | Cognitive Science, Bioethics | ★★★☆☆ Backup |

**Primary recommendation:** Contact **Janice Audet** first - she handles biomedical science and trade science, which aligns perfectly with genomic foundation models for clinical applications.

**Secondary:** If Janice suggests the CS angle is stronger, **Susan Hartman** handles computer science.

**Recent news (June 2025):** MIT Press acquired University Science Books from AIP Publishing, strengthening their science textbook portfolio. Per director Amy Brand: *"USB's respected science list will complement our long-established publishing history."*

**Submission requirements:**
- Initial inquiry: Few paragraphs describing project, author, rationale (no attachments)
- Full proposal (when invited): Annotated TOC, sample chapters (intro + 1-2 body chapters), author credentials
- AI disclosure required: Must inform editors of any AI tool usage in manuscript preparation

**Resources:**
- Submissions: https://mitpress.mit.edu/submitting-book-proposal/
- Acquisitions staff: https://mitpress.mit.edu/about/acquisitions-staff/
- Response time: 2-4 months

**Pitch angle:** Emphasize clinical translation (Parts VI-VII) for Janice Audet; lead with biomedical applications and Mayo Clinic foreword.
