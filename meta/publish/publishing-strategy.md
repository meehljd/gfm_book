# Publishing Strategy: Genomic Foundation Models

**Document created:** 2026-01-13
**Status:** Strategic planning phase

---

## Executive Summary

*Genomic Foundation Models: From Sequence to Clinical Insight* is a mature, content-complete manuscript positioned to become the definitive graduate-level text at the intersection of deep learning and genomics. At ~339,000 words across 32 chapters, it exceeds typical graduate textbook scope while maintaining pedagogical rigor through three defined reader pathways.

**Key Decision:** Choose between traditional academic publishing (prestige, distribution, editorial support) vs. open-access/hybrid publishing (speed, reach, control).

## 2. Publishing Routes

### Option A: Traditional Academic Publisher

**Candidates (ranked by fit):**

| Publisher | Strengths | Considerations |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **MIT Press** | Premier technical publisher; AI/computational biology strength; prestige | Longer timeline; selective |
| **Cambridge UP** | Strong computational biology list; international reach | More traditional structure expected |
| **Oxford UP** | Interdisciplinary strength; open access options | May want shorter manuscript |
| **Springer Nature** | Computational biology series; faster process | Lower prestige signal |
| **CRC Press/Chapman & Hall** | Technical computing focus; flexible length | Less prestigious but pragmatic |

**Pros:**
- Professional editorial support
- Distribution networks (libraries, bookstores)
- Marketing resources
- Prestige signal for career
- Index creation support
- Print-on-demand options

**Cons:**
- 18-36 month timeline to publication
- Loss of content control
- Royalty typically 10-15%
- Potential word count pressure
- Cannot maintain open web version (usually)

### Option B: Open Access / Hybrid

**Platforms:**

| Platform | Model | Fit |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Self-published (current)** | Free web, optional PDF/print | Maximum control; no gatekeeping |
| **Leanpub** | Variable pricing; reader-supported | Technical audience familiar |
| **Bookdown/Quarto ecosystem** | Open source book publishing | Already using Quarto |
| **arXiv + print-on-demand** | Preprint + physical copies | Common in ML community |

**Hybrid approach:** Keep web version open, sell print/PDF through traditional publisher or self-publishing.

**Pros:**
- Immediate availability
- Maintain open web version
- Higher royalty (70-100%)
- Can update content continuously
- No word count limits
- Faster iteration

**Cons:**
- No prestige signal
- Self-marketing required
- No professional editorial support
- Print distribution limited

### Option C: University/Research Press

**Candidates:**
- Stanford CSLI Publications
- Morgan & Claypool (synthesis lectures series)
- Now Publishers (Foundations and Trends series)

**Pros:**
- Academic credibility
- Often allow open access
- Shorter timeline than major presses
- Flexible on length

**Cons:**
- Smaller distribution
- Less marketing support

## 3. Recommended Strategy

### Primary Recommendation: Dual-Track Approach

1. **Maintain open web version** at gfm.meehl.org (current)
2. **Pursue MIT Press or Cambridge UP** for prestige print edition
3. **Negotiate open-access clause** for online version to coexist

### Rationale

- Foundation model field moves fast - web version provides immediate impact
- Academic career benefits from university press publication
- Many publishers now accept "gold open access" arrangements
- Web version builds audience that drives print sales

### Fallback Strategy

If traditional publishers decline or impose unacceptable terms:
1. Self-publish print via Amazon KDP / IngramSpark
2. Sell PDF via Gumroad or Leanpub
3. Maintain free web version
4. Market through ML/genomics conferences and social media

- [ ] Correct Chapter 14 section IDs (41 replacements)
- [ ] Update stale cross-references
- [ ] Verify figure rendering (8 critical fixes)
- [ ] Run full cross-reference validation

### Phase 2: Front/Back Matter (Weeks 2-4)

- [ ] Write Acknowledgments section
- [ ] Create About the Author section
- [ ] Finalize glossary integration (Appendix F)
- [ ] Prepare index keyword list (for professional indexer)
- [ ] Bibliography DOI audit

### Phase 3: Proposal Package (Weeks 4-6)

- [ ] Write book overview (2 pages)
- [ ] Draft cover letter (customized per publisher)
- [ ] Prepare competitive analysis
- [ ] Create market analysis
- [ ] Polish sample chapters (recommend: Ch 5, 7, 14)
- [ ] Prepare figure samples (high-resolution)

## 5. Publisher Proposal Strategy

### Pitch Angle

> *The first comprehensive textbook for the emerging field of genomic foundation models - bringing together deep learning architectures and clinical genomics for graduate students and researchers who need to understand both domains.*

### Key Selling Points

1. **Timing:** Foundation models are transforming biomedicine; no competing textbook exists
2. **Audience:** Growing programs in computational biology, bioinformatics, clinical informatics
3. **Adoption potential:**
   - Graduate courses in computational genomics
   - Professional development for clinical lab directors
   - Research reference for foundation model developers
4. **Proven content:** Web version already receiving traffic; community validation
5. **Author platform:** Active researcher in the field; institutional backing (if applicable)

### Competitive Landscape

| Existing Books | Gap This Book Fills |
|---------------|---------------------|
| *Deep Learning for Genomics* (various) | No FM coverage; outdated |
| *Machine Learning in Genomics* (various) | Pre-foundation model era |
| *Bioinformatics* textbooks | Statistical focus; no DL depth |
| *Deep Learning* textbooks | No genomics application |

**Conclusion:** No direct competitor covers foundation models for genomics at textbook depth.
