## Remaining Items (Lower Priority)

These items were noted but not addressed in this review. Consider for future passes:

### Figures
- Chapter 13: Add DAG figure with backdoor path
- Chapter 19: Visual of breakpoints for splicing section
- Chapter 25: Before/after calibration curves figure (instead of flowchart)

### Depth Expansion (Optional)
- Chapter 12: Model comparison and selection methodology (sec-ch12-architecture-search-confounds)
- Chapter 13: Hierarchical models / partial pooling discussion
- Chapter 19: Separate protein structure/function section consideration
- Chapter 24: Decision theory sidebar
- Chapter 27: Expand clinical validation discussion

### Cross-Book Consistency
- Audit reading time estimates (may be underestimated for textbook use)
- Review all figures with >2 panels for consistent lettering (C&D style)
- Consider whether biological detail level is consistent across Part V chapters
