```
Scientific illustration of multiscale biological integration for future foundation models. Single panel with hierarchical visualization.

SCALE HIERARCHY (bottom to top):

LEVEL 1 (BOTTOM - Nucleotide):
- DNA sequence (ATCG letters)

- Scale: 1-10^6 bp

LEVEL 2 (Gene):
- Gene structure with exons/introns
- Regulatory elements
- Current models partially address
- Scale: 10^3-10^5 bp

LEVEL 3 (Protein):
- 3D structure, function
- Current protein FMs strong here
- Scale: 10^2-10^3 amino acids

LEVEL 4 (Cell):

### Post-Processing Notes
- Add specific scale numbers
- Include current model examples at each level
- Show integration challenges

### Fallback Description
"Multiscale integration vision: from nucleotides through genes, proteins, cells, tissues, organisms, to populations. Current FMs operate at single scales (DNA, protein, single-cell). Future models must bridge scales through hierarchical architectures, cross-scale attention, and causal structure encoding."

### Caption Recommendation
"Multiscale integration for future foundation models. Biology spans scales from nucleotides (10^0 bp) to populations (10^6+ individuals). Current foundation models excel at single scales: DNA language models at sequence level, protein models at structure level, single-cell models at cellular level. The frontier challenge: integrating across scales so that molecular perturbations can be traced to organismal phenotypes. Approaches include hierarchical architectures, cross-scale attention mechanisms, and explicit causal structure encoding."

## Figure 2: Agentic Scientific Systems

### Files

### Priority
**High** - Emerging paradigm

### Content Description
Vision for autonomous scientific agents that combine FMs with experimental automation for discovery.

### DALL-E Prompt
```
Scientific illustration of agentic scientific systems combining AI and automation. Single panel with system architecture.

CENTRAL AGENT (middle):
- LLM/FM-based reasoning engine
- Scientific knowledge base
- Hypothesis generation capability
- Experimental planning
Icon: Brain/AI symbol

CAPABILITIES (radiating from center):

PERCEPTION (top):
- Literature reading and synthesis
- Data interpretation
- Pattern recognition across experiments
- Integration with databases (UniProt, PDB, etc.)

REASONING (right):
- Hypothesis generation
- Experimental design
- Troubleshooting failures
- Causal inference

ACTION (bottom):
- Control lab automation
- Execute protocols
- Order reagents
- Run analyses

LEARNING (left):
- Update from experimental results
- Refine predictions
- Build scientific models
- Accumulate knowledge

AUTOMATION LAYER (bottom):
Connected to:
- Liquid handlers
- Sequencers
- Microscopes
- Synthesis platforms

HUMAN OVERSIGHT (top):
- Strategic direction
- Ethical boundaries
- Safety oversight
- Final decisions

CLOSED LOOP:
Agent proposes → Automation executes → Results return → Agent learns → Agent proposes improved hypothesis

EXAMPLE APPLICATION:
"Autonomous protein engineering: Agent proposes mutations, synthesis builds variants, assays test function, agent learns and iterates"

Professional futuristic scientific style, system architecture diagram, white background.

```

### Post-Processing Notes
- Add specific tool examples
- Include safety considerations
- Show human-AI collaboration

### Fallback Description
"Agentic scientific systems: central AI agent with perception (literature, data), reasoning (hypotheses, experiment design), action (lab automation control), and learning (update from results). Closed loop enables autonomous discovery with human oversight for strategic direction and safety."

### Caption Recommendation
"Agentic scientific systems for autonomous discovery. An AI agent combines foundation model capabilities (reasoning, hypothesis generation) with lab automation (liquid handlers, sequencers, synthesis). The closed loop: agent proposes experiments, automation executes, results return, agent learns and proposes improved hypotheses. Human oversight provides strategic direction, ethical boundaries, and safety constraints. Example application: autonomous protein engineering cycles through design-build-test-learn faster than human-only teams while maintaining scientific rigor."

### Caption Recommendation
"Learning health system integrating genomic foundation models. Clinical care generates data: genomic testing, FM-based interpretation, treatment decisions, outcomes. The learning loop: outcomes tracked against predictions, models updated on aggregated data, improved predictions deployed back to care. Multi-institutional networks amplify learning through federated approaches that preserve privacy. Governance layer ensures equity monitoring, consent compliance, and regulatory adherence.
