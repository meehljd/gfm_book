## Items Flagged for Manual Review

### 1. Em-Dashes (9 instances)

Em-dashes can be appropriate for emphasis but overuse creates breathless prose. Consider whether parentheses, commas, or sentence restructuring would improve readability.

| Line | Context | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 3 | "proxy---and proxies can lie" | KEEP - Epigraph; stylistic choice appropriate |
| 92 | "GERP = 4.5"---but what do these numbers" | REVIEW - Could use period and new sentence |
| 134 | "evidence---and when to look elsewhere---" | REVIEW - Double em-dash construction; consider restructuring |
| 206 | "function---but whether that impairment" | REVIEW - Could use period or semicolon |
| 249 | "active---it simply does something" | REVIEW - Could use semicolon |
| 291 | "millions---at the cost of" | REVIEW - Could use comma or period |
| 377 | "pathogenic"---it means" | KEEP - Direct contrast works well |
| 430 | "for---and what it trades away---" | REVIEW - Double em-dash; consider restructuring |
| 456 | "performance---methods appear to work" | REVIEW - Could use colon |

**Recommendation:** Review 7 of 9 instances. The epigraph and line 377 use em-dashes effectively for rhetorical punch; others may benefit from restructuring.

### 2. Enthusiasm Words (2 instances)

| Line | Word | Context | Recommendation |
|------|------|---------|----------------|
| 310 | "powerful" | "Why might this be more powerful than training..." | KEEP - Technical comparison in a question |
| 317 | "powerful" | "is subtle but powerful" | REVIEW - Could use "effective" or "useful" |

**Recommendation:** Line 317's "powerful" is borderline. The construction "subtle but powerful" is a common pattern that may read as slightly promotional. Consider "subtle but effective" or restructuring.

### 3. Long Sentences (40+ words)

The following sentences exceed 40 words and may benefit from splitting:

| Line | Word Count | First Words |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 22 | ~75 | "Whether you are interpreting variants..." |
| 29 | ~95 | "The conceptual foundations and practical methods..." |
| 31 | ~80 | "The field's response was to develop..." |
| 136 | ~70 | "A variant falling at a position with phyloP..." |
| 138 | ~75 | "The boundaries of conservation-based approaches..." |
| 186 | ~90 | "The method uses a naive Bayes classifier..." |
| 317 | ~75 | "By contrasting this set with the proxy-neutral class..." |
| 326 | ~65 | "Gene model annotations describe the local transcript..." |
| 366 | ~80 | "Subsequent versions (v1.1 onward) transitioned to..." |
| 453 | ~70 | "A diagnostic laboratory classifies a novel missense..." |
| 524 | ~70 | "The zero-shot scoring paradigm offers a partial..." |

**Recommendation:** Consider splitting the longest sentences (>70 words) for improved readability. The technical content often warrants detailed explanation, but some sentences could be restructured without losing precision.

### 4. Formulaic Transitions

| Pattern | Count | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| "However," at sentence start | 0 | Excellent |
| "Therefore," at sentence start | 0 | Excellent |
| "Thus," at sentence start | 0 | Excellent |
| "Moreover," at sentence start | 0 | Excellent |
| "Furthermore," at sentence start | 0 | Excellent |

**No formulaic transitions detected.** The chapter uses varied sentence openings and logical flow without relying on transition crutches.

## Summary

| Category | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| Auto-fixes applied | 0 |
| Em-dashes to review | 7 |
| Enthusiasm words to review | 1 |
| Long sentences (40+ words) | 11 |
| Formulaic transitions | 0 |

### Overall Assessment

This chapter is well-written with minimal AI-pattern artifacts. The prose is authoritative and direct. Primary concerns are:

1. **Em-dash overuse:** 9 instances throughout the chapter creates slightly breathless prose in places. Consider converting 3-4 instances to periods, semicolons, or restructured sentences.

2. **Long sentences:** Technical complexity sometimes leads to sentences exceeding 70 words. Breaking these up would improve readability without sacrificing precision.

3. **Minor enthusiasm word:** Single instance of "subtle but powerful" could be toned down.

### Next Steps

1. Review flagged em-dashes and decide which to retain for emphasis vs. convert to other punctuation
2. Consider splitting the longest sentences (those >70 words)
3. Optional: Revise "subtle but powerful" to "subtle but effective"
