## Items Flagged for Manual Review

### 1. Em-Dash Usage (Moderate)

The chapter uses em-dashes appropriately for parenthetical statements and list separations. Count: **9 instances** in prose (excluding table formatting).

| Line | Context |
|------|---------|
| 19 | "...cannot capture---but 3D structure is permissive..." |
| 71 | "...three genes---one near each boundary..." |
| 88 | Multiple em-dashes in loop extrusion explanation |
| 264 | "...any coding sequence---they rewire the regulatory topology" |
| 412 | "...1D models cannot capture---linear distance..." |
| 415 | "...rather than deterministic---contact predicts..." |

**Assessment:** Em-dash usage is appropriate and not excessive. The dashes serve to add parenthetical clarification or create dramatic pause where warranted. No action needed.

---

### 2. Long Sentences (Review Recommended)

Several sentences exceed 50 words. While complex scientific concepts sometimes require longer sentences, consider whether any could be split for clarity.

| Line | Word Count | First Words |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 22 | ~85 | "The human genome spans approximately two meters..." |
| 43 | ~75 | "Why did cells evolve multiple organizational levels..." |
| 64 | ~80 | "A compartments contain gene-rich, transcriptionally active..." |
| 88 | ~100 | "The cohesin protein complex loads onto chromatin..." |
| 135 | ~120 | "Hi-C extends this principle genome-wide..." |
| 269 | ~85 | "The clinical significance is clearest in structural variant..." |

**Recommendation:** Lines 135 (Hi-C description) and 88 (loop extrusion) are technically dense and may benefit from splitting. The concepts require careful explanation, but the sentence length may challenge readers. Consider reviewing these for potential paragraph breaks.

---

### 3. Formulaic Transitions (None Found)

Scanned for: "However,", "Therefore,", "Furthermore,", "Moreover,", "Additionally,", "Consequently,"

**Result:** None found at sentence starts. The chapter uses varied transitional strategies effectively.

---

### 4. False Enthusiasm Words (None Found)

Scanned for: "exciting", "fascinating", "remarkable", "groundbreaking", "revolutionary"

**Result:** None found. The chapter maintains appropriate scientific tone throughout.

---

### 5. Passive Voice Density (Low - Acceptable)

Spot-checked key paragraphs. Passive voice is used appropriately for:
- Describing experimental procedures (line 133: "Cells are crosslinked...")
- Describing observations (line 62: "chromosome territories...are distinguished")

**Assessment:** Passive voice usage is appropriate for a scientific text and not excessive.

---

## Style Strengths Noted

1. **Strong opening hook**: "Two meters of DNA. Ten micrometers of space. How it folds determines what it does." - Excellent concrete framing.

2. **Effective analogies**:
   - Cohesin as "a ring sliding along a rope" (line 88)
   - Contact matrix as "a table showing how often people from different neighborhoods meet" (line 135)

3. **Clear section organization**: Hierarchical structure from large-scale (territories) to fine-scale (loops) aids comprehension.

4. **Consistent callout usage**: Well-deployed "Predict Before You Look," "Stop and Think," and "Key Insight" callouts enhance learning.

5. **Appropriate technical precision**: Terms like "convergent CTCF pairs," "loop extrusion," and "population averaging" are used precisely and consistently.

## Recommendations Summary

| Priority | Item | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| Low | Long sentences (lines 88, 135) | Consider splitting for readability |
| None | Em-dash usage | Appropriate, no action |
| None | Passive voice | Acceptable for scientific writing |
| None | Transitions | Varied and effective |

## Conclusion

Chapter 21 demonstrates exemplary technical writing. No auto-fixes were required, and the flagged items are minor style considerations rather than errors. The chapter effectively explains complex 3D genome concepts through clear analogies, appropriate use of figures and tables, and well-structured pedagogy.

**Status:** CLEAN - No edits applied
