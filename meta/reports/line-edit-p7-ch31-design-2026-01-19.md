## Auto-Fixes Applied

### 1. "leverage" → "use"

**3 instances fixed:**

#### Line 80 - FIXED
**Before:**
```
Foundation models contribute as fitness predictors (A) or as generative priors (B); both leverage representations learned from millions of natural sequences.
```

**After:**
```
Foundation models contribute as fitness predictors (A) or as generative priors (B); both use representations learned from millions of natural sequences.
```

#### Line 121 - FIXED
**Before:**
```
*ESM-IF* leverages the representations learned by *ESM-2* to condition sequence generation on structural constraints, connecting the inverse folding task directly to the protein language model paradigm.
```

**After:**
```
*ESM-IF* uses the representations learned by *ESM-2* to condition sequence generation on structural constraints, connecting the inverse folding task directly to the protein language model paradigm.
```

#### Line 183 - FIXED
**Before:**
```
These approaches leverage the same saliency map computations used for model interpretation (@sec-ch25-gradient), running the analysis in reverse to guide design rather than explain predictions.
```

**After:**
```
These approaches use the same saliency map computations used for model interpretation (@sec-ch25-gradient), running the analysis in reverse to guide design rather than explain predictions.

## Flagged for Manual Review

### 1. Triple-Hyphen Em-Dash Construction

**Line 158:**
```
Multi-objective design produces **Pareto frontiers**---the set of solutions where no objective can be improved without worsening another---representing different trade-offs among objectives.
```

**Issue:** Uses `---` for em-dashes. While Quarto renders this correctly, consider whether this parenthetical information could be restructured to avoid the double em-dash construction.

**Suggested alternatives:**
1. Use parentheses: "**Pareto frontiers** (the set of solutions where no objective can be improved without worsening another), representing..."
2. Use a colon to introduce: "**Pareto frontiers**: the set of solutions where no objective can be improved without worsening another. These represent different trade-offs..."
3. Keep as-is if the em-dash style is intentional for emphasis

## Additional Observations

### No Issues Found For:
- **False enthusiasm words** (exciting, groundbreaking, revolutionary, remarkable, incredibly, tremendously, amazing, fantastic, transformative): None detected
- **Formulaic transitions** (Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally, In addition, As mentioned): None detected
- **Meta-commentary** ("In this section, we will..."): None detected

### Style Quality Notes

The chapter demonstrates clean, professional writing with:
- Appropriate use of technical terminology
- Well-structured callouts for learning objectives and knowledge checks
- Good balance of conceptual explanation and practical guidance
- Effective use of tables for comparison and summary

## Remaining Action Items

1. [x] ~~Apply 3 "leverage" → "use" substitutions (lines 80, 121, 183)~~ - COMPLETE
2. [ ] Review line 158 em-dash usage and decide on style preference
