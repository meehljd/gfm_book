## Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Auto-fixes applied | 0 |
| Items flagged for manual review | 8 |

**Overall Assessment:** This chapter is well-written with minimal style issues. No auto-fix patterns were found. A small number of items are flagged for manual review, primarily involving word choice that may or may not require changes depending on editorial judgment.

---

## Auto-Fixes Applied

**None required.** The following patterns were searched and not found:

- "in order to" (should be "to")
- "due to the fact that" (should be "because")
- "delve into" (should be "examine")
- "leverage" (should be "use")
- "crucial" (should be "important")
- "It is worth noting that" (delete)
- "In this section, we will..." (delete meta-commentary)

## Items Flagged for Manual Review

### 1. Em-Dash Usage (3 instances)

Em-dashes are used appropriately in this chapter and do not appear overused. All instances serve clear purposes:

| Line | Context | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 196 | Table cell: "Novel (no match > 0.7) --- " | **Keep** - Standard table notation for missing value |
| 276 | "...not importance---always validate with perturbation experiments." | **Keep** - Appropriate emphasis for critical warning |
| 400 | "Left: plausible but unfaithful---the explanation matches intuition..." | **Keep** - Effective for contrast |

**Verdict:** No action needed. Usage is appropriate and not excessive.

---

### 2. "Strikingly" (2 instances)

This word can indicate false enthusiasm but is used appropriately here to describe genuinely notable empirical observations:

| Line | Context | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 114 | "Different attribution methods can produce **strikingly** different importance maps" | Consider: "markedly different" or "substantially different" for more neutral tone |
| 282 | "certain heads exhibit **strikingly** structured patterns" | Consider: "highly structured" or "distinctly structured" |

**Verdict:** Optional changes. The word is not egregiously enthusiastic but could be replaced with more neutral alternatives if preferred.

---

### 3. "Surprising" (1 instance)

| Line | Context | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 220 | "representations encode secondary structure, solvent accessibility, contact maps, and even 3D coordinates to a **surprising** degree" | Consider: "to a notable degree" or "to a greater degree than expected" |

**Verdict:** Optional change. The sentence already qualifies this with "even," so "surprising" may be redundant. However, the observation being described (3D structure from sequence-only training) is genuinely unexpected in the field, so the word choice is defensible.

---

### 4. "Powerful" (1 instance)

| Line | Context | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 350 | "The concepts in this section are **powerful** but the techniques are still maturing" | Consider: "valuable" or "useful" for more neutral tone |

**Verdict:** Optional change. Within a callout box providing context, this usage is relatively mild.

---

### 5. Formulaic Transition "However," (1 instance)

| Line | Context | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| 262 | "**However,** genomic models differ from language models in ways that complicate direct transfer." | **Keep** - This is a genuine contrast following discussion of NLP techniques; the transition word is appropriate here |

**Verdict:** No action needed. Single occurrence of a genuinely contrastive transition.

---

### 6. Uses of "simply" and "just"

These filler words appear occasionally but in appropriate contexts:

| Line | Term | Context | Recommendation |
|------|------|---------|----------------|
| 41 | "simply" | "The most direct approach to measuring input importance is **simply** to change each base" | Consider removing - sentence works without it |
| Various | "just" | Used in several places appropriately | No changes needed |

**Verdict:** Line 41 could be tightened by removing "simply" but this is a minor edit.

---

## Style Observations (No Action Required)

### Strengths of This Chapter

1. **Clear structure:** The chapter follows a logical progression from attribution methods through motif discovery, probing, attention analysis, and validation.

2. **Effective callouts:** The callout boxes (Key Insight, Challenge Alert, Stop and Think) are well-placed and genuinely add value.

3. **Balanced technical depth:** Complex mathematical concepts (e.g., integrated gradients formula) are presented with appropriate context and interpretation.

4. **Strong closing:** The chapter concludes with a compelling restatement of the plausibility vs. faithfulness theme that ties back to the opening.

5. **Appropriate cross-references:** Links to related chapters (@sec-ch06-cnn, @sec-ch07-attention, etc.) are relevant and well-placed.

### No Issues Found

- No passive voice overuse
- No meta-commentary ("In this section, we will...")
- No corporate jargon ("leverage," "utilize," "synergy")
- No excessive hedging
- No redundant phrases

---

## Recommended Actions

### High Priority
None

### Low Priority (Optional)

1. **Line 114:** Consider "markedly different" instead of "strikingly different"
2. **Line 282:** Consider "highly structured" instead of "strikingly structured"
3. **Line 220:** Consider "to a notable degree" instead of "to a surprising degree"
4. **Line 41:** Consider removing "simply"

## Conclusion

Chapter 25 is in excellent shape from a line-editing perspective. The writing is clear, direct, and avoids most common style pitfalls. The flagged items are optional refinements rather than required fixes. The chapter demonstrates strong technical writing with effective pedagogical elements.

**Status:** Ready for publication pending optional refinements noted above.
