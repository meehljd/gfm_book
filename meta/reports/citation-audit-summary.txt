CITATION AUDIT: GAP CITATIONS PROPOSAL
=====================================

DOCUMENT: /root/gfm-book/meta/reports/gap-citations-diff-proposal.md
AUDIT DATE: 2026-01-18
STATUS: CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================

The proposal introduces 27 papers to support claims throughout the textbook.

AUDIT RESULTS:
- Total Papers Proposed: 27
- Papers Already in Bibliography: 0 (ALL MISSING)
- Appropriately Cited Claims: 20
- Claims Needing Revision: 3
- Papers Needing Verification: 5

CRITICAL ISSUES (BLOCKING)
==========================

1. BIBLIOGRAPHY NOT UPDATED
   Issue: All 27 proposed papers are MISSING from references.bib
   Impact: Implementation will cause compilation failures
   Action: Add complete BibTeX entries for all papers before any text changes

2. UNSUPPORTED CLAIMS (Even with proposed citations):
   a) ESM3 functional protein generation (Ch. 16, Change 3)
      - Cites Hayes et al. but lacks experimental validation details
      - Single example doesn't support broad generalization
      - Fix: Add methodology for fluorescence validation

   b) Benchmark circularity severity (Ch. 12, Change 10)
      - Claims advantages "disappeared" but no quantification
      - Fix: Specify how many methods affected, magnitude of loss

   c) FDA applicability to genomic FMs (Ch. 27, Change 15)
      - FDA guidance exists but genomic FM adoption is unstated
      - Fix: Add evidence of actual deployment in genomic domain

3. PAPERS NEEDING VERIFICATION (2025 publications):
   - hayes_esm_2025 (ESM3 protein models)
   - wang_genomic_2025 (Genomic Touchstone benchmark)
   - dibaeinia_prsformer_2025 (PRS transformers)
   - madhu_heist_2025 (Spatial foundation models)

   Action: Cross-check against published versions before citation

WELL-SUPPORTED ADDITIONS (APPROVE AS-IS)
==========================================

Foundational Definitions:
- Bommasani et al. (2022) - Foundation Model definition
- Trop et al. (2024) - Genomic FM landscape

Essential Methodology:
- Daveysmith & Treasure (2003) - Mendelian randomization
- Maurano et al. (2012) - Regulatory variant enrichment

Critical Counterbalances:
- Karollus et al. (2023) - PLM-VEP limitations
- Grimm et al. (2015) - Benchmark circularity
- Swanson et al. (2022) - PLM performance gaps

Historical Context:
- Baek et al. (2021) - RoseTTAFold
- Farh et al. (2015) - Non-coding variant statistics
- Aibar et al. (2017) - SCENIC GRN baseline

POTENTIAL REDUNDANCIES
=======================

1. BERTology (Ch. 25, Change 13)
   - Check existing sections for attention analysis coverage
   - May duplicate existing interpretability citations

2. Mendelian Randomization Background (Ch. 26)
   - Well-known concept, but citation for grounding is valuable
   - Verify explanation length is proportional to novelty

MISSING CITATIONS (Still Unsupported)
=====================================

1. Comparative Performance Quantification (Ch. 28)
   - Text: "modest but consistent improvements"
   - Missing: Specific magnitudes (X-Y% for which phenotypes?)
   - Fix: Add numbers from Elgart et al. data

2. FDA Guidance Clinical Relevance (Ch. 27)
   - Text: FDA requirements "must" be considered
   - Missing: Evidence of adoption in genomic FM field
   - Fix: Add deployment examples or clinical trials

RECOMMENDATIONS BY PRIORITY
============================

MUST DO (Blocking):
1. Update bibliography with 27 BibTeX entries
2. Verify 2025 paper publications exist
3. Quantify claims where numerical support exists

SHOULD DO (High Value):
1. Revise ESM3 text for experimental validation
2. Add benchmark circularity magnitudes
3. Check for BERTology/attention analysis redundancy

CONSIDER (Nice to Have):
1. Verify FDA guidance adoption in genomic domain
2. Consolidate if existing sections cover similar ground

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
=======================

Before implementing text changes:

[ ] Bibliography entries added for all 27 papers
[ ] BibTeX syntax validated
[ ] Quarto compilation successful
[ ] 2025 papers independently verified
[ ] Performance claims quantified where possible
[ ] ESM3 validation details added
[ ] Redundancy check completed (BERTology, etc.)
[ ] FDA applicability evidence reviewed
[ ] All cross-reference syntax verified

VERDICT
=======

APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS

The proposal correctly identifies gaps in citation coverage. Papers are well-chosen
and appropriately motivated. However, implementation must:

1. Complete bibliography integration (blocking issue)
2. Verify 2025 publications (medium priority)
3. Revise text for clarity/quantification (3 sections need revision)
4. Check for redundancies (1 section needs verification)

Estimated effort: 4-6 hours for bibliography setup + 2-3 hours for text revisions
and verifications.
