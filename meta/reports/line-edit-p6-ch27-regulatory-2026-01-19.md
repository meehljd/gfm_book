## Auto-Fixes Applied

**None required.** The chapter does not contain any of the targeted phrases:

- "in order to" - Not found
- "due to the fact that" - Not found
- "delve into" - Not found
- "leverage" - Not found
- "crucial" - Not found
- "It is worth noting that" - Not found
- "In this section, we will..." - Not found

The chapter appears to have already been edited for these common wordy constructions.

## Items Flagged for Manual Review

### 1. Em-Dash Usage (5 instances)

The chapter uses em-dashes (rendered as `---` in source) in several places. While these are used appropriately in most cases, review for potential overuse or consider comma alternatives.

**Line 62:**
> "By considering both dimensions, regulators can calibrate evidentiary requirements proportionally---demanding rigorous clinical trials for high-risk applications while enabling faster pathways for lower-risk tools."

*Assessment:* Appropriate use. The em-dash introduces an explanatory elaboration. Consider whether a colon might work equally well.

**Line 77:**
> "This architectural flexibility---a technical strength---becomes a regulatory liability when approval pathways assume static behavior."

*Assessment:* Good use of em-dashes for parenthetical insertion. This is a clear, effective construction.

**Line 231:**
> "However, gradients encode information about the data that produced them---a sufficiently sophisticated attack can reconstruct input data from gradients..."

*Assessment:* Appropriate use. The em-dash signals an important consequence.

**Line 279 (multiple):**
> "Differential privacy works by adding noise calibrated so that any individual's presence or absence in the training data cannot substantially change model outputs---an adversary cannot determine whether a specific person's data was used."
>
> "Secure computation works by distributing computation across parties such that no single party can reconstruct inputs---but cryptographic operations are computationally expensive."
>
> "Synthetic data works by learning and sampling from a statistical model rather than memorizing individuals---but the statistical model may fail to capture the rare events that matter most clinically."

*Assessment:* This paragraph uses em-dashes in a parallel structure to present technique-then-limitation patterns. The repetition is intentional and effective for clarity. No change needed.

**Line 319:**
> "Who would be the inventor---the model developer, the user who prompted the generation, or the AI itself?"

*Assessment:* Good use. The em-dash introduces a list of alternatives. This is standard and clear.

**Recommendation:** No changes needed. Em-dash usage is moderate (5 instances across 524 lines) and purposeful. The parallel structure in line 279 is pedagogically effective.

### 2. Formulaic Transitions (1 instance)

**Line 207:**
> "However, ethical questions remain about whether participants could have anticipated AI applications."

*Assessment:* "However" at sentence start is acceptable in academic writing. This is an appropriate contrast signal. No change needed.

---

### 3. False Enthusiasm Words

**None found.** The chapter avoids enthusiasm amplifiers such as:
- exciting
- fascinating
- remarkable
- incredible
- groundbreaking
- revolutionary
- amazing
- cutting-edge
- transformative
- breakthrough
- game-changing

The prose maintains appropriate scholarly tone throughout.

---

### 4. Meta-Commentary Patterns

**Line 452:**
> "The governance principles in this chapter recur throughout the application chapters ahead:"

*Assessment:* This is forward-reference guidance in a callout box, not problematic meta-commentary. It helps readers understand cross-chapter connections. Retain as-is.

---

## Overall Assessment

This chapter demonstrates excellent adherence to style guidelines:

1. **Concise phrasing:** No wordy constructions detected
2. **Scholarly tone:** Avoids enthusiasm language
3. **Clear structure:** Em-dashes used purposefully, not excessively
4. **Minimal meta-commentary:** Forward references are contextual, not filler

**Quality rating:** Excellent - no edits required

---

## Recommendations

1. **No immediate action needed.** The chapter is well-edited.

2. **Consider during final review:** The em-dash constructions in line 279 create an effective parallel pattern, but if the book style guide prefers minimal em-dash usage, these could be converted to "but" conjunctions within the sentences.

3. **Cross-chapter consistency:** Verify that other Part 6 chapters maintain similar quality level.
