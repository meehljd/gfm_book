	abstract = {Many contemporary large-scale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a nonlinear fashion, while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). The knockoff filter introduced by Barber and Candès provides a framework for variable selection in linear regression with FDR control. This method operates by creating knockoff copies of the covariates, constructing test statistics which treat the original features and knockoffs as exchangeable, and selecting those variables which are substantially better at explaining the response than their corresponding knockoffs. We extend the knockoff filter to a setting that is substantially more general. We make essentially no assumptions about the conditional distribution of the response—i.e. we do not assume any knowledge of Y|X—and we provide theoretical guarantees concerning the FDR in finite samples which are completely free of any modelling assumptions on Y|X.},
