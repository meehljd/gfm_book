	abstract = {A polygenic score (PGS) or polygenic risk score (PRS) is an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation—genetic liability—has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.},

We analyze the first decade of polygenic scoring studies (2008–2017, inclusive), and find that 67\% of studies included exclusively European ancestry participants and another 19\% included only East Asian ancestry participants. Only 3.8\% of studies were among cohorts of African, Hispanic, or Indigenous peoples. We find that predictive performance of European ancestry-derived polygenic scores is lower in non-European ancestry samples (e.g. African ancestry samples: t = −5.97, df = 24, p = 3.7 × 10−6), and we demonstrate the effects of methodological choices in polygenic score distributions for worldwide populations. These findings highlight the need for improved treatment of linkage disequilibrium and variant frequencies when applying polygenic scoring to cohorts of non-European ancestry, and bolster the rationale for large-scale GWAS in diverse human populations.},

PRS-CS utilizes a high-dimensional Bayesian regression framework, and is distinct from previous work by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes, which is robust to varying genetic architectures, provides substantial computational advantages, and enables multivariate modeling of local LD patterns. Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRS-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of genetic architectures, especially when the training sample size is large. We apply PRS-CS to predict six common complex diseases and six quantitative traits in the Partners HealthCare Biobank, and further demonstrate the improvement of PRS-CS in prediction accuracy over alternative methods.},

Human genetics studies have started to unravel the genetic underpinnings of this disorder.Gene discovery efforts have rapidly transitioned from family-based studies (for example, those that led to the discovery of familial hypercholesterolaemia) to large cohorts that facilitate both common and rare variant association studies.Common variant association studies have confirmed ∼60 genetic loci with a robust association with coronary disease, the majority of which are of modest effect size and in non-coding regions. Rare variant association studies have linked inactivating mutations in at least nine genes with risk of coronary artery disease.Human genetics and large-scale biobanks can facilitate drug development for coronary artery disease by highlighting causal biology and helping to understand the phenotypic consequences of lifelong deficiency of a given protein.Genomic medicine may provide patients and their health care providers with genetic data that will aid in coronary artery disease prevention and treatment.Genome editing to introduce mutations that are protective against coronary artery disease into the population could prove curative with a one-time injection, although substantial additional work is needed to confirm efficacy and safety, and to address the underlying ethics.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of regions in the genome that contain genetic variants that increase risk for complex traits and diseases. However, the variants uncovered in GWAS are typically not biologically causal, but rather, correlated to the true causal variant through linkage disequilibrium (LD). To discern the true causal variant(s), a variety of statistical fine-mapping methods have been proposed to prioritize variants for functional validation.In this work we introduce a new approach, fastPAINTOR, that leverages evidence across correlated traits, as well as functional annotation data, to improve fine-mapping accuracy at pleiotropic risk loci. To improve computational efficiency, we describe an new importance sampling scheme to perform model inference. First, we demonstrate in simulations that by leveraging functional annotation data, fastPAINTOR increases fine-mapping resolution relative to existing methods. Next, we show that jointly modeling pleiotropic risk regions improves fine-mapping resolution compared to standard single trait and pleiotropic fine mapping strategies. We report a reduction in the number of SNPs required for follow-up in order to capture 90\% of the causal variants from 23 SNPs per locus using a single trait to 12 SNPs when fine-mapping two traits simultaneously. Finally, we analyze summary association data from a large-scale GWAS of lipids and show that these improvements are largely sustained in real data.The fastPAINTOR framework is implemented in the PAINTOR v3.0 package which is publicly available to the research community http://bogdan.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/software/paintorSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Prediction of disease risk is an essential part of preventative medicine, often guiding clinical management. Risk prediction typically includes risk factors such as age, sex, family history of disease and lifestyle (e.g. smoking status); however, in recent years, there has been increasing interest to include genomic information into risk models. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) aggregate the effects of many genetic variants across the human genome into a single score and have recently been shown to have predictive value for multiple common diseases. In this review, we summarize the potential use cases for seven common diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, coronary artery disease, obesity, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease) where PRS has or could have clinical utility. PRS analysis for these diseases frequently revolved around (i) risk prediction performance of a PRS alone and in combination with other non-genetic risk factors, (ii) estimation of lifetime risk trajectories, (iii) the independent information of PRS and family history of disease or monogenic mutations and (iv) estimation of the value of adding a PRS to specific clinical risk prediction scenarios. We summarize open questions regarding PRS usability, ancestry bias and transferability, emphasizing the need for the next wave of studies to focus on the implementation and health-economic value of PRS testing. In conclusion, it is becoming clear that PRS have value in disease risk prediction and there are multiple areas where this may have clinical utility.},

	abstract = {Methods for genetic risk prediction have been widely investigated in recent years. However, most available training data involves European samples, and it is currently unclear how to accurately predict disease risk in other populations. Previous studies have used either training data from European samples in large sample size or training data from the target population in small sample size, but not both. Here, we introduce a multiethnic polygenic risk score that combines training data from European samples and training data from the target population. We applied this approach to predict type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Latino cohort using both publicly available European summary statistics in large sample size (Neff = 40k) and Latino training data in small sample size (Neff = 8k). Here, we attained a {\textgreater}70\% relative improvement in prediction accuracy (from R2 = 0.027 to 0.047) compared to methods that use only one source of training data, consistent with large relative improvements in simulations. We observed a systematically lower load of T2D risk alleles in Latino individuals with more European ancestry, which could be explained by polygenic selection in ancestral European and/or Native American populations. We predict T2D in a South Asian UK Biobank cohort using European (Neff = 40k) and South Asian (Neff = 16k) training data and attained a {\textgreater}70\% relative improvement in prediction accuracy, and application to predict height in an African UK Biobank cohort using European (N = 113k) and African (N = 2k) training data attained a 30\% relative improvement.

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are poised to improve biomedical outcomes via precision medicine. However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation of PRS is that those available today are several times more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric biases in genome-wide association studies, thus highlighting that—unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations—clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement for European-descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in leveling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date. To realize the full and equitable potential of PRS, greater diversity must be prioritized in genetic studies, and summary statistics must be publically disseminated to ensure that health disparities are not increased for those individuals already most underserved.},

	abstract = {Stratification of women according to their risk of breast cancer based on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) could improve screening and prevention strategies. Our aim was to develop PRSs, optimized for prediction of estrogen receptor (ER)-specific disease, from the largest available genome-wide association dataset and to empirically validate the PRSs in prospective studies. The development dataset comprised 94,075 case subjects and 75,017 control subjects of European ancestry from 69 studies, divided into training and validation sets. Samples were genotyped using genome-wide arrays, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected by stepwise regression or lasso penalized regression. The best performing PRSs were validated in an independent test set comprising 11,428 case subjects and 18,323 control subjects from 10 prospective studies and 190,040 women from UK Biobank (3,215 incident breast cancers). For the best PRSs (313 SNPs), the odds ratio for overall disease per 1 standard deviation in ten prospective studies was 1.61 (95\%CI: 1.57–1.65) with area under receiver-operator curve (AUC) = 0.630 (95\%CI: 0.628–0.651). The lifetime risk of overall breast cancer in the top centile of the PRSs was 32.6\%. Compared with women in the middle quintile, those in the highest 1\% of risk had 4.37- and 2.78-fold risks, and those in the lowest 1\% of risk had 0.16- and 0.27-fold risks, of developing ER-positive and ER-negative disease, respectively. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that this PRS was well calibrated and predicts disease risk accurately in the tails of the distribution. This PRS is a powerful and reliable predictor of breast cancer risk that may improve breast cancer prevention programs.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many variants associated with complex traits, but identifying the causal gene(s) is a major challenge. In the present study, we present an open resource that provides systematic fine mapping and gene prioritization across 133,441 published human GWAS loci. We integrate genetics (GWAS Catalog and UK Biobank) with transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic data, including systematic disease–disease and disease–molecular trait colocalization results across 92 cell types and tissues. We identify 729 loci fine mapped to a single-coding causal variant and colocalized with a single gene. We trained a machine-learning model using the fine-mapped genetics and functional genomics data and 445 gold-standard curated GWAS loci to distinguish causal genes from neighboring genes, outperforming a naive distance-based model. Our prioritized genes were enriched for known approved drug targets (odds ratio = 8.1, 95\% confidence interval = 5.7, 11.5). These results are publicly available through a web portal (http://genetics.opentargets.org), enabling users to easily prioritize genes at disease-associated loci and assess their potential as drug targets.},

We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general “phase change” phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

Determining the significance of results in the face of testing a genomewide set of multiple hypotheses, most of which are producing noisy, null-distributed association signals, presents a challenge to the wide community of association researchers. Rather than each study engaging in independent evaluation of significance standards, we have undertaken the task of developing such standards for genomewide significance, based on data collected by the International Haplotype Map Consortium. We report an estimated testing burden of a million independent tests genomewide in Europeans, and twice that number in Africans. We further identify the sensitivity of the testing burden to the required significance level, with implications to staged design of association studies. Genet.

The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations.

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases — complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease. In this context, we review the evidence supporting the personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk profiling.},

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R(2) increased from 20.1\% to 25.3\% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8\% to 12.0\% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.},

	abstract = {Heritability, the proportion of variation in a particular trait that is attributable to genetic factors, is a fundamental parameter in genetics. First introduced by Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher nearly a century ago, it is key to the response to selection in evolutionary biology and agriculture, and to the prediction of disease risk in medicine.Heritability is not necessarily constant in a population. Changes in the method of measurement, environmental change and the effects of migration, selection and inbreeding all can alter heritability.The use of high-density genetic marker technologies allows novel estimation methods of heritability, for example, estimation in unpedigreed populations and estimation within families — free of assumptions about variation between families.The estimation of heritability for new phenotypes — those that can be measured with recently developed technologies — provides knowledge about the nature of between-individual differences in core biological processes. For example, amounts of gene expression, brain scanning measurements, the length of telomeres and biochemical compounds measured by mass spectrometry show substantial heritability.Heritabilities are often surprisingly large and at present there is no consensus theory to explain why heritabilities have the values they do. Fortunately, the incredible pace of gene–phenotype discoveries in many species will allow new insights to these questions in the near future.},

	abstract = {Common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are predicted to collectively explain 40–50\% of phenotypic variation in human height, but identifying the specific variants and associated regions requires huge sample sizes1. Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90 kb, covering about 21\% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel2) account for 40\% (45\%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10–20\% (14–24\%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries.},

	abstract = {Large-scale biobanks provide comprehensive electronic health records (EHRs) that capture detailed clinical phenotypes, potentially enhancing disease prediction. However, traditional polygenic risk score (PRS) methods rely on simplified phenotype definitions or predefined trait sets, limiting their ability to represent the complex structures embedded within EHRs. To address this gap, we introduce EHR-embedding-enhanced PRS (EEPRS), leveraging phenotype embeddings derived from EHRs to improve PRSs using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. Employing embedding methods such as Word2Vec and GPT, we conducted EHR-embedding-based GWASs and identified a cardiovascular cluster via hierarchical clustering of genetic correlations. Across 41 traits in the UK Biobank, EEPRS consistently outperformed single-trait PRSs, particularly within this cluster. PRS-based phenome-wide association studies further demonstrated robust associations between EHR-embedding-based PRS and circulatory system diseases. We then developed EEPRS\_optimal, a data-adaptive method that uses cross-validation to select the best embedding, yielding additional improvements. We also developed MTAG\_EEPRS for multi-trait PRSs, which further improved prediction accuracy compared to single-trait PRSs and MTAG\_PRS. Finally, we validated the benefits of EEPRS in the All of Us cohort for seven selected diseases. Overall, EEPRS represents a robust and interpretable framework, enhancing single-trait and multi-trait PRSs by integrating EHR embeddings.},

	abstract = {Background: Twin studies have provided evidence that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to schizophrenia (SZ) risk. Heritability estimates of SZ in twin samples have varied methodologically. This study provides updated heritability estimates based on nationwide twin data and an improved statistical methodology. Methods: Combining two nationwide registers, the Danish Twin Register and the Danish Psychiatric Research Register, we identified a sample of twins born between 1951 and 2000 (N = 31,524 twin pairs). Twins were followed until June 1, 2011. Liability threshold models adjusting for censoring with inverse probability weighting were used to estimate probandwise concordance rates and heritability of the diagnoses of SZ and SZ spectrum disorders. Results: The probandwise concordance rate of SZ is 33\% in monozygotic twins and 7\% in dizygotic twins. We estimated the heritability of SZ to be 79\%. When expanding illness outcome to include SZ spectrum disorders, the heritability estimate was almost similar (73\%). Conclusions: The key strength of this study is the application of a novel statistical method accounting for censoring in the follow-up period to a nationwide twin sample. The estimated 79\% heritability of SZ is congruent with previous reports and indicates a substantial genetic risk. The high genetic risk also applies to a broader phenotype of SZ spectrum disorders. The low concordance rate of 33\% in monozygotic twins demonstrates that illness vulnerability is not solely indicated by genetic factors.},

	abstract = {Evidence for a major role of genetic factors in the determination of body mass index (BMI) comes from studies of related individuals. However, heritability estimates for BMI vary widely between studies and the reasons for this remain unclear. While some variation is natural due to differences between populations and settings, study design factors may also explain some of the heterogeneity. We performed a systematic review that identified eighty-eight independent estimates of BMI heritability from twin studies (total 140,525 twins) and twenty-seven estimates from family studies (42,968 family members). BMI heritability estimates from twin studies ranged from 0.47 to 0.90 (5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.58/0.75/0.87) and were generally higher than those from family studies (range: 0.24-0.81; 5th/50th/95th centiles: 0.25/0.46/0.68). Meta-regression of the results from twin studies showed that BMI heritability estimates were 0.07 (P=0.001) higher in children than in adults; estimates increased with mean age among childhood studies (+0.012 per year, P=0.002), but decreased with mean age in adult studies (-0.002 per year, P=0.002). Heritability estimates derived from AE twin models (which assume no contribution of shared environment) were 0.12 higher than those from ACE models (P\&lt;0.001), whilst lower estimates were associated with self-reported versus DNA-based determination of zygosity (-0.04, P=0.02), and with self-reported versus measured BMI (-0.05, P=0.03). Together, the above factors explained 47\% of the heterogeneity in estimates of BMI heritability from twin studies. In summary, while some variation in BMI heritability is expected due to population-level differences, study design factors explained nearly half the heterogeneity reported in twin studies. The genetic contribution to BMI appears to vary with age and may have a greater influence during childhood than adult life.},

	abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of risk loci for complex traits, only a handful of the biologically causal variants, responsible for association at these loci, have been successfully identified. Current statistical methods for identifying causal variants at risk loci either use the strength of association signal in an iterative conditioning framework, or estimate probabilities for variants to be causal. A main drawback of existing methods is that they rely on the simplifying assumption of a single causal variant at each risk locus which is typically invalid at many risk loci. In this work, we propose a new statistical frameworks that allows for the possibility of an arbitrary number of causal variants when estimating the posterior probability of a variant being causal. A direct benefit of our approach is that we predict a set of variants for each locus that under reasonable assumptions will contain all of the true causal variants with a high confidence level (e.g. 95\%) even when the locus contains multiple causal variants. We use simulations to show that our approach provides 20-50\% improvement in our ability to identify the causal variants compared to the existing methods at loci harboring multiple causal variants. We validate our approach using empirical data from a eQTL study of CHI3L2 to identify new causal variants that affect gene expression at this locus.},

	doi = {10.1111/rssb.12388},
	abstract = {We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, with a particular focus on quantifying uncertainty in which variables should be selected. The approach is based on a new model—the ‘sum of single effects’ model, called ‘SuSiE’—which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of ‘single-effect’ vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure—iterative Bayesian stepwise selection (IBSS)—which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods but, instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under SuSiE. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a credible set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outperform existing methods for this task, and we illustrate their application to fine mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable-selection problems.},

	abstract = {Summary: Annotating genetic variants, especially non-coding variants, for the purpose of identifying pathogenic variants remains a challenge. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and non-coding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants. However, SVMs cannot capture non-linear relationships among the features, which can limit performance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture non-linear relationships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples and features. We exploit Compute Unified Device Architecture-compatible graphics processing units and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN training. DANN achieves about a 19\% relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14\% relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADD’s SVM methodology.Availability and implementation: All data and source code are available at https://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public\_data/DANN/.Contact:  xhx@ics.uci.edu},

They apply a new Bayesian method for analysis of fine-mapping data sets, using this to define sets of SNPs likely to contain causal disease-associated variants.},
