# Predicting Transcriptional Effects (ExPecto)

## Extending DeepSEA (ExPecto, Zhou et al., 2018)

- ExPecto is a modular framework built on a refined DeepSEA architecture.
- Designed to predict the tissue-specific transcriptional effects of mutations *ab initio* (from sequence only), without having trained on any variant information.

## Architecture Components

1. **Epigenomic Effects Model**  
   - A deep CNN predicts probabilities for 2,002 histone mark, TF, and DNA accessibility profiles across over 200 tissues/cell types.

2. **Spatial Feature Transformation**  
   - Summarizes the predicted epigenomic information across a 40 kb region.

3. **Tissue-Specific Prediction**  
   - Regularized linear models use the transformed features to predict Pol II–transcribed gene expression in 218 tissues/cell types.

## Clinical Utility

- Provides an end-to-end computational framework for *in silico* prediction of disease-associated regulatory variation.
- Demonstrates potential for interpreting clinically-relevant mutations, including those missed by traditional quantitative genetics.
