	abstract = {Much work has been done to apply machine learning and deep learning to genomics tasks, but these applications usually require extensive domain knowledge, and the resulting models provide very limited interpretability. Here, we present the Nucleic Transformer, a conceptually simple but effective and interpretable model architecture that excels in the classification of DNA sequences. The Nucleic Transformer employs self-attention and convolutions on nucleic acid sequences, leveraging two prominent deep learning strategies commonly used in computer vision and natural language analysis. We demonstrate that the Nucleic Transformer can be trained without much domain knowledge to achieve high performance in Escherichia coli promoter classification, viral genome identification, enhancer classification, and chromatin profile predictions.},

	abstract = {Many contemporary large-scale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a non-linear fashion, such as when the response is binary. Although this modelling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to control the fraction of false discoveries effectively even in high dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general high dimensional non-linear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of ‘model-X’ knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure that was originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with n⩾p, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires that the covariates are random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown or estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the controlled variable selection problem in such generality but, in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we apply our procedure to data from a case–control study of Crohn's disease in the UK, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.},

	abstract = {Three billion years of evolution has produced a tremendous diversity of protein molecules1, but the full potential of proteins is likely to be much greater. Accessing this potential has been challenging for both computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to have functions. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences, and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efficient neural architecture for molecular systems that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, layers for efficiently synthesizing three-dimensional structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. Chroma achieves protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics and even natural-language prompts. The experimental characterization of 310 proteins shows that sampling from Chroma results in proteins that are highly expressed, fold and have favourable biophysical properties. The crystal structures of two designed proteins exhibit atomistic agreement with Chroma samples (a backbone root-mean-square deviation of around 1.0 Å). With this unified approach to protein design, we hope to accelerate the programming of protein matter to benefit human health, materials science and synthetic biology.},

ML-guided protein design requires models, trained on local sequence-function information, to accurately predict distant fitness peaks. In this work, we evaluate neural networks’ capacity to extrapolate beyond their training data. We perform model-guided design using a panel of neural network architectures trained on protein G (GB1)-Immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding data and experimentally test thousands of GB1 designs to systematically evaluate the models’ extrapolation. We find each model architecture infers markedly different landscapes from the same data, which give rise to unique design preferences. We find simpler models excel in local extrapolation to design high fitness proteins, while more sophisticated convolutional models can venture deep into sequence space to design proteins that fold but are no longer functional. Our findings highlight how each architecture’s inductive biases prime them to learn different aspects of the protein fitness landscape.},

	abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'8-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Geometric deep learning has broad applications in biology, a domain where relational structure in data is often intrinsic to modelling the underlying phenomena. Currently, efforts in both geometric deep learning and, more broadly, deep learning applied to biomolecular tasks have been hampered by a scarcity of appropriate datasets accessible to domain specialists and machine learning researchers alike. To address this, we introduce Graphein as a turn-key tool for transforming raw data from widely-used bioinformatics databases into machine learning-ready datasets in a high-throughput and flexible manner. Graphein is a Python library for constructing graph and surface-mesh representations of biomolecular structures, such as proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules, and biological interaction networks for computational analysis and machine learning. Graphein provides utilities for data retrieval from widely-used bioinformatics databases for structural data, including the Protein Data Bank, the AlphaFold Structure Database, chemical data from ZINC and ChEMBL, and for biomolecular interaction networks from STRINGdb, BioGrid, TRRUST and RegNetwork. The library interfaces with popular geometric deep learning libraries: DGL, Jraph, PyTorch Geometric and PyTorch3D though remains framework agnostic as it is built on top of the PyData ecosystem to enable inter-operability with scientific computing tools and libraries. Graphein is designed to be highly flexible, allowing the user to specify each step of the data preparation, scalable to facilitate working with large protein complexes and interaction graphs, and contains useful pre-processing tools for preparing experimental files. Graphein facilitates network-based, graph-theoretic and topological analyses of structural and interaction datasets in a high-throughput manner. We envision that Graphein will facilitate developments in computational biology, graph representation learning and drug discovery. Availability and implementation: Graphein is written in Python.

Experimental validation is both labor-intensive and costly, highlighting the need for accurate, scalable computational methods to predict the effects of genetic variants across the entire genome. Inspired by recent progress in natural language processing, unsupervised pretraining on large protein sequence databases has proven successful in extracting complex information related to proteins. These models showcase their ability to learn variant effects in coding regions using an unsupervised approach. Expanding on this idea, we here introduce the Genomic Pre-trained Network (GPN), a model designed to learn genome-wide variant effects through unsupervised pretraining on genomic DNA sequences. Our model also successfully learns gene structure and DNA motifs without any supervision. To demonstrate its utility, we train GPN on unaligned reference genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and seven related species within the Brassicales order and evaluate its ability to predict the functional impact of genetic variants in A. thaliana by utilizing allele frequencies from the 1001 Genomes Project and a comprehensive database of GWAS. Notably, GPN outperforms predictors based on popular conservation scores such as phyloP and phastCons. Our predictions for A. thaliana can be visualized as sequence logos in the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/gbenegas/gpn-arabidopsis). We provide code (https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn) to train GPN for any given species using its DNA sequence alone, enabling unsupervised prediction of variant effects across the entire genome.},

To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity.

The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections.

	abstract = {The identification and characterization of essential genes are central to our understanding of the core biological functions in eukaryotic organisms, and has important implications for the treatment of diseases caused by, for example, cancers and pathogens. Given the major constraints in testing the functions of genes of many organisms in the laboratory, due to the absence of in vitro cultures and/or gene perturbation assays for most metazoan species, there has been a need to develop in silico tools for the accurate prediction or inference of essential genes to underpin systems biological investigations. Major advances in machine learning approaches provide unprecedented opportunities to overcome these limitations and accelerate the discovery of essential genes on a genome-wide scale. Here, we developed and evaluated a large language model- and graph neural network (LLM-GNN)-based approach, called 'Bingo', to predict essential protein-coding genes in the metazoan model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster as well as in Mus musculus and Homo sapiens (a HepG2 cell line) by integrating LLM and GNNs with adversarial training. Bingo predicts essential genes under two 'zero-shot' scenarios with transfer learning, showing promise to compensate for a lack of high-quality genomic and proteomic data for non-model organisms. In addition, the attention mechanisms and GNNExplainer were employed to manifest the functional sites and structural domain with most contribution to essentiality. In conclusion, Bingo provides the prospect of being able to accurately infer the essential genes of little- or under-studied organisms of interest, and provides a biological explanation for gene essentiality.},

	abstract = {Design of de novo synthetic regulatory DNA is a promising avenue to control gene expression in biotechnology and medicine. Using mutagenesis typically requires screening sizable random DNA libraries, which limits the designs to span merely a short section of the promoter and restricts their control of gene expression. Here, we prototype a deep learning strategy based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) by learning directly from genomic and transcriptomic data. Our ExpressionGAN can traverse the entire regulatory sequence-expression landscape in a gene-specific manner, generating regulatory DNA with prespecified target mRNA levels spanning the whole gene regulatory structure including coding and adjacent non-coding regions. Despite high sequence divergence from natural DNA, in vivo measurements show that 57\% of the highly-expressed synthetic sequences surpass the expression levels of highly-expressed natural controls. This demonstrates the applicability and relevance of deep generative design to expand our knowledge and control of gene expression regulation in any desired organism, condition or tissue.},

Datasets emerging from these experiments can be combined to construct perturbative “maps of biology”, in which readouts from various manipulations (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 knockout, CRISPRi knockdown, compound treatment) are placed in unified, relatable embedding spaces allowing for the generation of genome-scale sets of pairwise comparisons. These maps of biology capture known biological relationships and uncover new associations which can be used for downstream discovery tasks. Construction of these maps involves many technical choices in both experimental and computational protocols, motivating the design of benchmark procedures to evaluate map quality in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here, we (1) establish a standardized terminology for the steps involved in perturbative map building, (2) introduce key classes of benchmarks to assess the quality of such maps, (3) construct 18 maps from four genome-scale datasets employing different cell types, perturbation technologies, and data readout modalities, (4) generate benchmark metrics for the constructed maps and investigate the reasons for performance variations, and (5) demonstrate utility of these maps to discover new biology by suggesting roles for two largely uncharacterized genes.},

The application of LLMs extends beyond conventional linguistic boundaries, encompassing specialized linguistic systems developed within various scientific disciplines. This growing interest has led to the advent of scientific LLMs, a novel subclass specifically engineered for facilitating scientific discovery. As a burgeoning area in the community of AI for Science, scientific LLMs warrant comprehensive exploration. However, a systematic and up-to-date survey introducing them is currently lacking. In this paper, we endeavor to methodically delineate the concept of "scientific language", whilst providing a thorough review of the latest advancements in scientific LLMs. Given the expansive realm of scientific disciplines, our analysis adopts a focused lens, concentrating on the biological and chemical domains. This includes an in-depth examination of LLMs for textual knowledge, small molecules, macromolecular proteins, genomic sequences, and their combinations, analyzing them in terms of model architectures, capabilities, datasets, and evaluation. Finally, we critically examine the prevailing challenges and point out promising research directions along with the advances of LLMs. By offering a comprehensive overview of technical developments in this field, this survey aspires to be an invaluable resource for researchers navigating the intricate landscape of scientific LLMs.},

While language models trained on protein sequences have been studied at a smaller scale, little is known about what they learn about biology as they are scaled up. In this work we train models up to 15 billion parameters, the largest language models of proteins to be evaluated to date. We find that as models are scaled they learn information enabling the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. We present ESMFold for high accuracy end-to-end atomic level structure prediction directly from the individual sequence of a protein. ESMFold has similar accuracy to AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold for sequences with low perplexity that are well understood by the language model. ESMFold inference is an order of magnitude faster than AlphaFold2, enabling exploration of the structural space of metagenomic proteins in practical timescales.},

FreeBayes and neural network approaches have overcome this limitation for variant calling, and we implemented a similar approach for DNV identification.
Results We developed a DNV calling framework that uses Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), FreeBayes and a neural network trained on Integrative Genomics Viewer pile-up plots (IGV-bot). We identified DNVs in 2,390 WGS trios and benchmarked results against heuristics based on GATK parameters. Results were validated in silico and with Sanger sequencing, with the latter showing true positive rates of 98.4\% and 97.3\% for SNVs and indels, respectively. Taken together we describe a scalable framework for DNV identification based on both FreeBayes and neural network methods.

	abstract = {The next phase of genome biology research requires understanding how DNA sequence encodes phenotypes, from the molecular to organismal levels. How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequence through the use of a new deep learning architecture called Enformer that is able to integrate long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Notably, Enformer outperformed the best team on the critical assessment of genome interpretation (CAGI5) challenge for noncoding variant interpretation with no additional training. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict promoter-enhancer interactions directly from DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of growing human disease associations to cell-type-specific gene regulatory mechanisms and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution. To foster these downstream applications, we have made the pre-trained Enformer model openly available, and provide pre-computed effect predictions for all common variants in the 1000 Genomes dataset.

	abstract = {Prediction of chromatin interactions from DNA sequence has been a significant research challenge in the last couple of years. Several solutions have been proposed, most of which are based on encoder-decoder architecture, where 1D sequence is convoluted, encoded into the latent representation, and then decoded using 2D convolutions into the Hi-C pairwise chromatin spatial proximity matrix. Those methods, while obtaining high correlation scores and improved metrics, produce Hi-C matrices that are artificial - they are blurred due to the deep learning model architecture. In our study, we propose the HiCDiffusion model that addresses this problem. We first train the encoder-decoder neural network and then use it as a component of the diffusion model - where we guide the diffusion using a latent representation of the sequence, as well as the final output from the encoder-decoder. That way, we obtain the high-resolution Hi-C matrices that not only better resemble the experimental results - improving the Fréchet inception distance by an average of 12 times, with the highest improvement of 35 times - but also obtain similar classic metrics to current state-of-the-art encoder-decoder architectures used for the task.},

	abstract = {Biomedical image analysis is fundamental for biomedical discovery in cell biology, pathology, radiology, and many other biomedical domains. Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection, and recognition of relevant objects. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9 imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery.},

While tools for sequencing, synthesis, and editing of genomic code have transformed biological research, intelligently composing new biological systems would also require a deep understanding of the immense complexity encoded by genomes. We introduce Evo 2, a biological foundation model trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs from a highly curated genomic atlas spanning all domains of life. We train Evo 2 with 7B and 40B parameters to have an unprecedented 1 million token context window with single-nucleotide resolution. Evo 2 learns from DNA sequence alone to accurately predict the functional impacts of genetic variation—from noncoding pathogenic mutations to clinically significant BRCA1 variants—without task-specific finetuning. Applying mechanistic interpretability analyses, we reveal that Evo 2 autonomously learns a breadth of biological features, including exon–intron boundaries, transcription factor binding sites, protein structural elements, and prophage genomic regions. Beyond its predictive capabilities, Evo 2 generates mitochondrial, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic sequences at genome scale with greater naturalness and coherence than previous methods. Guiding Evo 2 via inference-time search enables controllable generation of epigenomic structure, for which we demonstrate the first inference-time scaling results in biology. We make Evo 2 fully open, including model parameters, training code, inference code, and the OpenGenome2 dataset, to accelerate the exploration and design of biological complexity.},

	abstract = {Language-supervised pretraining has proven to be a valuable method for extracting semantically meaningful features from images, serving as a foundational element in multimodal systems within the computer vision and medical imaging domains. However, the computed features are limited by the information contained in the text, which is particularly problematic in medical imaging, in which the findings described by radiologists focus on specific observations. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity of paired imaging–text data due to concerns over the leakage of personal health information. In this work, we fundamentally challenge the prevailing reliance on language supervision for learning general-purpose biomedical imaging encoders. We introduce RAD-DINO, a biomedical image encoder pretrained solely on unimodal biomedical imaging data that obtains similar or greater performance than state-of-the-art biomedical-language-supervised models on a diverse range of benchmarks. Specifically, the quality of learned representations is evaluated on standard imaging tasks (classification and semantic segmentation), and a vision–language alignment task (text report generation from images). To further demonstrate the drawback of language supervision, we show that features from RAD-DINO correlate with other medical records (for example, sex or age) better than language-supervised models, which are generally not mentioned in radiology reports. Finally, we conduct a series of ablations determining the factors in RAD-DINO’s performance. In particular, we observe that RAD-DINO’s downstream performance scales well with the quantity and diversity of training data, demonstrating that image-only supervision is a scalable approach for training a foundational biomedical image encoder.},

However, to impact clinical practice, models must achieve a high level of both verifiable performance and utility. We augment the utility of automated report generation by incorporating localisation of individual findings on the image - a task we call grounded report generation - and enhance performance by incorporating realistic reporting context as inputs. We design a novel evaluation framework (RadFact) leveraging the logical inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to quantify report correctness and completeness at the level of individual sentences, while supporting the new task of grounded reporting. We develop MAIRA-2, a large radiology-specific multimodal model designed to generate chest X-ray reports with and without grounding. MAIRA-2 achieves state of the art on existing report generation benchmarks and establishes the novel task of grounded report generation.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present MedImageInsight, an open-source medical imaging embedding model. MedImageInsight is trained on medical images with associated text and labels across a diverse collection of domains, including X-Ray, CT, MRI, dermoscopy, OCT, fundus photography, ultrasound, histopathology, and mammography. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate MedImageInsight's ability to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) or human expert level performance across classification, image-image search, and fine-tuning tasks. Specifically, on public datasets, MedImageInsight achieves SOTA in CT 3D medical image retrieval, as well as SOTA in disease classification and search for chest X-ray, dermatology, and OCT imaging. Furthermore, MedImageInsight achieves human expert performance in bone age estimation (on both public and partner data), as well as AUC above 0.9 in most other domains. When paired with a text decoder, MedImageInsight achieves near SOTA level single image report findings generation with less than 10{\textbackslash}\% the parameters of other models. Compared to fine-tuning GPT-4o with only MIMIC-CXR data for the same task, MedImageInsight outperforms in clinical metrics, but underperforms on lexical metrics where GPT-4o sets a new SOTA. Importantly for regulatory purposes, MedImageInsight can generate ROC curves, adjust sensitivity and specificity based on clinical need, and provide evidence-based decision support through image-image search (which can also enable retrieval augmented generation). In an independent clinical evaluation of image-image search in chest X-ray, MedImageInsight outperformed every other publicly available foundation model evaluated by large margins (over 6 points AUC), and significantly outperformed other models in terms of AI fairness (across age and gender). We hope releasing MedImageInsight will help enhance collective progress in medical imaging AI research and development.},

Here, we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps with a combination of base LLM improvements, medical domain fine-tuning and new strategies for improving reasoning and grounding through ensemble refinement and chain of retrieval. Med-PaLM 2 scores up to 86.5\% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19\%, and demonstrates dramatic performance increases across MedMCQA, PubMedQA and MMLU clinical topics datasets. Our detailed human evaluations framework shows that physicians prefer Med-PaLM 2 answers to those from other physicians on eight of nine clinical axes. Med-PaLM 2 also demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor across all evaluation metrics, particularly on new adversarial datasets designed to probe LLM limitations (P {\textless} 0.001). In a pilot study using real-world medical questions, specialists preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to generalist physician answers 65\% of the time. While specialist answers were still preferred overall, both specialists and generalists rated Med-PaLM 2 to be as safe as physician answers, demonstrating its growing potential in real-world medical applications.},

To facilitate this process, we introduce Stabl, a general machine learning method that identifies a sparse, reliable set of biomarkers by integrating noise injection and a data-driven signal-to-noise threshold into multivariable predictive modeling. Evaluation of Stabl on synthetic datasets and five independent clinical studies demonstrates improved biomarker sparsity and reliability compared to commonly used sparsity-promoting regularization methods while maintaining predictive performance; it distills datasets containing 1,400–35,000 features down to 4–34 candidate biomarkers. Stabl extends to multi-omic integration tasks, enabling biological interpretation of complex predictive models, as it hones in on a shortlist of proteomic, metabolomic and cytometric events predicting labor onset, microbial biomarkers of pre-term birth and a pre-operative immune signature of post-surgical infections.

We trained a machine learning model that classifies UC vs. CD samples. In parallel, we integrated multi-omics data to unveil patient subgroups in each of the two indications independently and analyzed the molecular phenotypes of these patient subpopulations.The high performance of the model showed that multi-omics signatures are able to discriminate between the two indications. The most predictive features of the model, both known and novel omics signatures for IBD, can potentially be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Patient subgroup analysis in each indication uncovered omics features associated with disease severity in UC patients, and with tissue inflammation in CD patients. This culminates with the observation of two CD subpopulations characterized by distinct inflammation profiles.Our work unveiled potential biomarkers to discriminate between CD and UC and to stratify each population into well-defined subgroups, offering promising avenues for the application of precision medicine strategies.},

We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general “phase change” phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

Recent efforts introduced self-supervised foundation models to address these challenges, yet existing approaches do not leverage pathologist knowledge by design. In this study, we present a novel approach to designing foundation models for computational pathology, incorporating pathologist expertise, semi-automated data curation, and a diverse dataset from over 15 laboratories, including 58 tissue types, and encompassing 129 different histochemical and immunohistochemical staining modalities. We demonstrate that our model "RudolfV" surpasses existing state-of-the-art foundation models across different benchmarks focused on tumor microenvironment profiling, biomarker evaluation, and reference case search while exhibiting favorable robustness properties.

	abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021) on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.},

We propose a simple yet effective solution based on providing additional tokens to the input sequence of the Vision Transformer to fill that role. We show that this solution fixes that problem entirely for both supervised and self-supervised models, sets a new state of the art for self-supervised visual models on dense visual prediction tasks, enables object discovery methods with larger models, and most importantly leads to smoother feature maps and attention maps for downstream visual processing.},

Training of such networks follows mostly the supervised learning paradigm, where sufficiently many input-output pairs are required for training. Acquisition of large training sets is one of the key challenges, when approaching a new task. In this paper, we aim for generic feature learning and present an approach for training a convolutional network using only unlabeled data. To this end, we train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. In contrast to supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101, Caltech-256). While such generic features cannot compete with class specific features from supervised training on a classification task, we show that they are advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform the SIFT descriptor.},

Our model utilizes a short- range transformer architecture and is trained on a large dataset of human exomic sequences derived from the Tapestry study. Through a series of ablation studies and scaling experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in pre- dicting next token accuracy and identifying clinically pathogenic variants. We also show that our model outperforms existing models in a range of downstream tasks, including variant effect prediction and disease state identification. In fact, our largest STRAND variant (1B parameters) surpassed previous benchmarks, demonstrating a mean accuarcy of 0.880 (8.2\% improvement over the original NT and 7\% improvement over NT-v2). Furthermore, we construct a unique exomic ClinVar dataset to evaluate the model’s performance on pathogenicity and disease states.

Building on these insights, our work incorporates several recent modifications to the standard DINOv2 framework from the literature to optimize the training of pathology FMs. We also apply a post-training procedure for fine-tuning models on higher-resolution images to further enrich the information encoded in the embeddings. We present three novel pathology FMs trained on up to two orders of magnitude fewer WSIs than those used to train other state-of-the-art FMs while demonstrating a comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks. Even the model trained on TCGA alone (12k WSIs) outperforms most existing FMs and, on average, matches Virchow2, the second-best FM published to date.

However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H\&E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10\% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.},

However, analyzing tissue samples and writing pathology reports is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and non-standardized. To address this problem, we present HistoGPT, the first vision language model that simultaneously generates reports from multiple pathology images. It was trained on more than 15,000 whole slide images from over 6,000 dermatology patients with corresponding pathology reports. The generated reports match the quality of human-written reports, as confirmed by a variety of natural language processing metrics and domain expert evaluations. We show that HistoGPT generalizes to six geographically diverse cohorts and can predict tumor subtypes and tumor thickness in a zero-shot fashion. Our model demonstrates the potential of an AI assistant that supports pathologists in evaluating, reporting, and understanding routine dermatopathology cases.},

	abstract = {Microscopic interpretation of histopathology images underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions. While advances in vision-language modeling raise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78\% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.},

We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.},

Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68\% (95\% CI: [60\%, 76\%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.},

LVLMs transform pathology image embeddings into tokens recognizable by large language models, facilitating zero-shot image classification, description generation, question answering, and interactive diagnostics. In clinical practice, pathological assessments often require the analysis of entire tissue slides, integrating information from multiple sub-regions and magnification levels. However, existing LVLM frameworks have been restricted to the analysis of small, predefined regions of interest, lacking the ability to analyze pyramidal, gigapixel-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce ALPaCA (Adapting Llama for Pathology Context Analysis), and train the first general-purpose slide-level LVLM, leveraging 35,913 WSIs with curated descriptions alongside 341,051 question and answer pairs encompassing diverse diagnoses, procedures, and tissue types. By developing LongFormer, a vision-text interactive slide-level adaptor, and integrating it with a Gaussian mixture model-based prototyping adaptor, followed by training with Llama3.1, ALPaCA achieves superior performance in slide-level question answering, achieving over 90\% accuracy in close-ended tests and high accuracy in open-ended questions as evaluated by expert pathologists, highlighting its potential for slide-level computer-aided diagnosis systems. Additionally, we show that ALPaCA can be readily fine-tuned on in-depth, organ-specific, or disease-specific datasets, underscoring its adaptability and utility for specialized pathology tasks.},

The high resolution of WSIs and the variability of morphological features present significant challenges, complicating the large-scale annotation of data for high-performance applications. To address this challenge, current efforts have proposed the use of pretrained image encoders through transfer learning from natural image datasets or self-supervised learning on publicly available histopathology datasets, but have not been extensively developed and evaluated across diverse tissue types at scale. We introduce UNI, a general-purpose self-supervised model for pathology, pretrained using more than 100 million images from over 100,000 diagnostic H\&E-stained WSIs ({\textgreater}77 TB of data) across 20 major tissue types. The model was evaluated on 34 representative CPath tasks of varying diagnostic difficulty. In addition to outperforming previous state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate new modeling capabilities in CPath such as resolution-agnostic tissue classification, slide classification using few-shot class prototypes, and disease subtyping generalization in classifying up to 108 cancer types in the OncoTree classification system. UNI advances unsupervised representation learning at scale in CPath in terms of both pretraining data and downstream evaluation, enabling data-efficient artificial intelligence models that can generalize and transfer to a wide range of diagnostically challenging tasks and clinical workflows in anatomic pathology.},

Prior models have often resorted to subsampling a small portion of tiles for each slide, thus missing the important slide-level context4. Here we present Prov-GigaPath, a whole-slide pathology foundation model pretrained on 1.3 billion 256 × 256 pathology image tiles in 171,189 whole slides from Providence, a large US health network comprising 28 cancer centres. The slides originated from more than 30,000 patients covering 31 major tissue types. To pretrain Prov-GigaPath, we propose GigaPath, a novel vision transformer architecture for pretraining gigapixel pathology slides. To scale GigaPath for slide-level learning with tens of thousands of image tiles, GigaPath adapts the newly developed LongNet5 method to digital pathology. To evaluate Prov-GigaPath, we construct a digital pathology benchmark comprising 9 cancer subtyping tasks and 17 pathomics tasks, using both Providence and TCGA data6. With large-scale pretraining and ultra-large-context modelling, Prov-GigaPath attains state-of-the-art performance on 25 out of 26 tasks, with significant improvement over the second-best method on 18 tasks. We further demonstrate the potential of Prov-GigaPath on vision–language pretraining for pathology7,8 by incorporating the pathology reports. In sum, Prov-GigaPath is an open-weight foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various digital pathology tasks, demonstrating the importance of real-world data and whole-slide modelling.},

Due to this color shift between laboratories, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with images from one lab often underperform on unseen images from the other lab. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the generalization error, mainly grouped into two categories: stain color augmentation and stain color normalization. The former simulates a wide variety of realistic stain variations during training, producing stain-invariant CNNs. The latter aims to match training and test color distributions in order to reduce stain variation. For the first time, we compared some of these techniques and quantified their effect on CNN classification performance using a heterogeneous dataset of hematoxylin and eosin histopathology images from 4 organs and 9 pathology laboratories. Additionally, we propose a novel unsupervised method to perform stain color normalization using a neural network. Based on our experimental results, we provide practical guidelines on how to use stain color augmentation and stain color normalization in future computational pathology applications.},

Our method involves taking a single-channel representation of a lowmagnification RGB overview of the WSI in which the pixel values are bimodally distributed such that H\&E-stained tissue is easily distinguished from both background and a wide variety of artefacts. We demonstrate our method on 30 WSIs prepared from a wide range of institutions and WSI digital scanners, each containing substantial artefacts, and compare it to segmentations provided by Otsu thresholding and Histolab tissue segmentation and pen filtering tools. We found that our method segmented the tissue and fully removed all artefacts in 29 out of 30 WSIs, whereas Otsu thresholding failed to remove any artefacts, and the Histolab pen filtering tools only partially removed the pen marks. The beauty of our approach lies in its simplicity: manipulating RGB colour space and using Otsu thresholding allows for the segmentation of H\&E-stained tissue and the rapid removal of artefacts without the need for machine learning or parameter tuning.},

	abstract = {Spatial transcriptomics technology remains resource-intensive and unlikely to be routinely adopted for patient care soon. This hinders the development of novel precision medicine solutions and, more importantly, limits the translation of research findings to patient treatment. Here, we present DeepSpot, a deep-set neural network that leverages recent foundation models in pathology and spatial multi-level tissue context to effectively predict spatial transcriptomics from H\&E images. DeepSpot substantially improved gene correlations across multiple datasets from patients with metastatic melanoma, kidney, lung, or colon cancers as compared to previous state-of-the-art. Using DeepSpot, we generated 1 792 TCGA spatial transcriptomics samples (37 million spots) of the melanoma and renal cell cancer cohorts. We anticipate this to be a valuable resource for biological discovery and a benchmark for evaluating spatial transcriptomics models. We hope that DeepSpot and this dataset will stimulate further advancements in computational spatial transcriptomics analysis.},

	abstract = {Cell type-specific gene expression from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is valuable for breast cancer precision oncology but available cohorts are still limited due to its high cost. Deconvolution methods infer cell type-specific expression from bulk RNA-seq at a lower cost, yet expenses and processing time of bulk RNA-seq are also non-negligible and limit their application too. To address these limitations, we developed SLIDE-EX (SLide-based Inference of DEconvolved gene EXpression), a deep-learning tool that predicts cell type-specific gene expression and abundances directly from routine breast cancer histopathology whole slide images (WSIs), using deconvolved bulk RNA-seq data as training labels. Trained on the TCGA-breast cohort and tested in cross validation and on an independent cohort of 160 cases, SLIDE-EX robustly infers the expression of thousands of genes across 9 distinct cell types, performing best for cancer associated fibroblasts and cancer cells. The abundance of these two cell types could also be robustly predicted, together with that of myeloid cells. The robustly predicted genes reflect key biological functions of their respective cell types. From a translational perspective, the inferred cell type specific expression profiles predict chemotherapy response more accurately than models based on direct prediction from the slides or from the inferred bulk expression in two independent cohorts. Going forward, SLIDE-EX is a generic approach that opens up possibilities for rapid, cost-effective cell type-specific gene expression inference in potentially any cancer type, further democratizing the characterization of the tumor microenvironment.},

Two primary approaches have emerged for this task: supervised sequence-to-function models trained on functional genomics experimental data and self-supervised DNA language models that learn evolutionary constraints on sequences. However, the field currently lacks consistently curated datasets with accurate labels, especially for non-coding variants, that are necessary to comprehensively benchmark these models and advance the field. In this work, we present TraitGym, a curated dataset of regulatory genetic variants that are either known to be causal or are strong candidates across 113 Mendelian and 83 complex traits, along with carefully constructed control variants. We frame the causal variant prediction task as a binary classification problem and benchmark various models, including functional-genomics-supervised models, self-supervised models, models that combine machine learning predictions with curated annotation features, and ensembles of these. Our results provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of different approaches for predicting the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variants. We find that alignment-based models CADD and GPN-MSA compare favorably for Mendelian traits and complex disease traits, while functional-genomics-supervised models Enformer and Borzoi perform better for complex non-disease traits. The benchmark, including a Google Colab notebook to evaluate a model in a few minutes, is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/songlab/TraitGym.},

We developed four predictive models: 1) based on common RA risk factors, 2) model 1 incorporating polygenic risk scores (PRS) with principal components, 3) model 1 and SNPs after feature reduction, and 4) model 1 and SNPs with kernel principal component analysis. Each model was assessed using logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM). Performance metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and F1-score. The fourth model, integrating SNPs with XGBoost, outperformed all other models. In addition, the XGBoost model that combines genomic data with conventional phenotypic predictors significantly enhanced predictive accuracy, achieving the highest AUC of 0.90 and an F1 score of 0.83. The DeLong test confirmed significant differences in AUC between this model and the others (p-values {\textless} 0.0001), particularly highlighting its efficacy in utilizing complex genetic information. These findings emphasize the advantage of combining in-depth genomic data with advanced machine learning for RA risk prediction. The most robust performance of the XGBoost model, which integrated both conventional risk factors and individual SNPs, demonstrates its potential as a tool in personalized medicine for complex diseases like RA. This approach offers a more nuanced and effective RA risk assessment strategy, underscoring the need for further studies to extend broader applications.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex disease resulting from multiple genetic and environmental pathogenic factors. The genetic factors include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have been reported to be associated with RA, but their specific role in the pathogenesis of RA remains unexplained. This study explains the potential role of RA risk-associated SNPs in its pathogenesis in order to provide a basis for understanding the genetic complexity of RA. Several roles of these SNPs are described in this study, and may also aid in the design of a therapeutic strategy for RA. Furthermore, novel potential therapeutic sites have also been researched, resulting in the identification of three novel therapeutic targets. The therapeutic strategies for the treatment of RA include inflammatory pathway-targeting drugs, which alleviate inflammation in joints. There is always a need for novel therapeutic targets that can play a role in alleviating inflammation in autoimmune diseases including RA. Therefore, these novel therapeutic sites are very important, and further experimental studies are required.

Abstract
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are reported to be associated with many diseases, including autoimmune diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), about 152 SNPs are reported to account for {\textasciitilde}15\% of its heritability. These SNPs may result in the alteration of gene expression and may also affect the stability of mRNA, resulting in diseased protein. Therefore, in order to predict the underlying mechanism of these SNPs and identify novel therapeutic sites for the treatment of RA, several bioinformatics tools were used. The damaging effect of 23 non-synonymous SNPs on proteins using different tools suggested four SNPs, including rs2476601 in PTPN22, rs5029941 and rs2230926 in TNFAIP3, and rs34536443 in TYK2, to be the most damaging. In total, 42 of 76 RA-associated intronic SNPs were predicted to create or abolish potential splice sites. Moreover, the analysis of 11 RA-associated UTR SNPs indicated that only one SNP, rs1128334, located in 3′UTR of ETS1, caused functional pattern changes in BRD-BOX. For the identification of novel therapeutics sites to treat RA, extensive gene–gene interaction network interactive pathways were established, with the identification of 13 potential target sites for the development of RA drugs, including three novel target genes. The anticipated effect of these findings on RA pathogenesis may be further validated in both in vivo and in vitro studies.},

	abstract = {Thousands of genomic regions have been associated with heritable human diseases, but attempts to elucidate biological mechanisms are impeded by an inability to discern which genomic positions are functionally important. Evolutionary constraint is a powerful predictor of function, agnostic to cell type or disease mechanism. Single-base phyloP scores from 240 mammals identified 3.3\% of the human genome as significantly constrained and likely functional. We compared phyloP scores to genome annotation, association studies, copy-number variation, clinical genetics findings, and cancer data. Constrained positions are enriched for variants that explain common disease heritability more than other functional annotations. Our results improve variant annotation but also highlight that the regulatory landscape of the human genome still needs to be further explored and linked to disease.},

However, current tools do not predict RNA-seq expression profiles because of modeling challenges. Here, we introduce Borzoi, a model that learns to predict cell-type-specific and tissue-specific RNA-seq coverage from DNA sequence. Using statistics derived from Borzoi’s predicted coverage, we isolate and accurately score DNA variant effects across multiple layers of regulation, including transcription, splicing and polyadenylation. Evaluated on quantitative trait loci, Borzoi is competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on individual regulatory functions. By applying attribution methods to the derived statistics, we extract cis-regulatory motifs driving RNA expression and post-transcriptional regulation in normal tissues. The wide availability of RNA-seq data across species, conditions and assays profiling specific aspects of regulation emphasizes the potential of this approach to decipher the mapping from DNA sequence to regulatory function.},

	abstract = {A polygenic score (PGS) or polygenic risk score (PRS) is an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation—genetic liability—has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.},

	abstract = {Objective To test the ability of machine learning (ML) approaches with clinical and genomic biomarkers to predict methotrexate treatment response in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Demographic, clinical, and genomic data from 643 patients of European ancestry with early RA (mean age 54 years; 70\% female) subdivided into a training (n = 336) and validation cohort (n = 307) were used. The genomic data comprised 160 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with RA or methotrexate metabolism. Response to methotrexate monotherapy was defined as good or moderate by the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) response criteria at the 3-month follow-up. Supervised ML methods were trained with 5 repeats and 10-fold cross-validation using the training cohort. Prediction performance was validated in the independent validation cohort. Results Supervised ML methods combining age, sex, smoking, rheumatoid factor, baseline Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) scores and 160 SNPs predicted EULAR response at 3 months with the area under the receiver operating curve of 0.84 (P = 0.05) in the training cohort and achieved a prediction accuracy of 76\% (P = 0.05) in the validation cohort (sensitivity 72\%, specificity 77\%). Intergenic SNPs rs12446816, rs13385025, rs113798271, and ATIC (rs2372536) had variable importance above 60.0 and along with baseline DAS28 scores were among the top predictors of methotrexate response. Conclusion Pharmacogenomic biomarkers combined with baseline DAS28 scores can be useful in predicting response to methotrexate in patients with early RA. Applying ML to predict treatment response holds promise for guiding effective RA treatment choices, including timely escalation of RA therapies.},

	abstract = {Genomic variation underlies human phenotypic diversity, disease susceptibility, and evolutionary adaptation. Although large-scale genomic sequencing has transformed our ability to map genetic variation, accurately modeling and interpreting this data remains challenging due to fundamental limitations in existing genomic foundation models (GFMs). Current genomic models typically treat DNA simplistically as linear textual sequences, overlooking critical biological context, such as genomic structural annotations, regulatory elements, and functional contexts central to genomic interpretation. As a result, these models are prone to positional memorization of common sequences, severely limiting their generalization to biologically meaningful tasks. Here, we introduce BioToken, a modular and extendable tokenization framework designed to encode genomic variants and biologically relevant structural annotations directly into genomic representations. By utilizing intrinsic inductive biases, BioToken facilitates meaningful representation learning and generalization across diverse molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, alternative splicing, and variant pathogenicity prediction. Built on BioToken, our genomic foundation model, BioFM, achieves competitive or superior results relative to specialized models (e.g., Enformer, SpliceTransformer) across a comprehensive suite of genomic benchmarks, including noncoding pathogenicity, expression modulation, sQTL prediction, and long-range genomic interactions. Notably, BioFM achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters (265M), substantially reducing training costs and computational requirements. Our findings high-light the substantial advantages of integrating biologically-informed inductive biases into genomic foundation modeling, providing a robust and accessible path forward in genomics. We provide our code and model checkpoints to support further research in this direction.},

The genomic language models are pre-trained with large-scale DNA sequences and can generate robust representations of these sequences by learning the genomic context. However, few studies can estimate the predictability of gene expression levels and bridge these two classes of models together to explore individualized gene expression prediction. In this manuscript, we propose UKBioBERT as a DNA language model pre-trained with genetic variants from UK BioBank. We demonstrate that UKBioBERT generates informative embeddings capable of identifying gene functions, and improving gene expression prediction in cell lines, thereby enhancing our understanding of gene expression predictability. Building upon these embeddings, we combine UKBioBERT with state-of-the-art sequence-to-function architectures, Enformer and Borzoi, to create UKBioFormer and UKBioZoi. These models exhibit better performance in predicting highly predictable gene expression levels and can be generalized across different cohorts. Furthermore, UKBioFormer effectively captures the relationship between genetic variants and expression variations, enabling in-silico mutation analyses. Collectively, our findings underscore the value of integrating genomic language models and sequence-to-function approaches for advancing functional genomics research.},

We survey open questions in genomics amenable to the use of gLMs, and motivate the use of gLMs and the transformer architecture for these problems. We discuss the potential of gLMs for modelling the genome using unsupervised pretraining tasks, specifically focusing on the power of zero- and few-shot learning. We explore the strengths and limitations of the transformer architecture, as well as the strengths and limitations of current gLMs more broadly. Additionally, we contemplate the future of genomic modelling beyond the transformer architecture, based on current trends in research.

These are all among the core problems in the RNA field. With the rapid growth of sequencing technology, we have accumulated a massive amount of unannotated RNA sequences. On the other hand, expensive experimental observatory results in only limited numbers of annotated data and 3D structures. Hence, it is still challenging to design computational methods for predicting their structures and functions. The lack of annotated data and systematic study causes inferior performance. To resolve the issue, we propose a novel RNA foundation model (RNA-FM) to take advantage of all the 23 million non-coding RNA sequences through self-supervised learning. Within this approach, we discover that the pre-trained RNA-FM could infer sequential and evolutionary information of non-coding RNAs without using any labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate RNA-FM's effectiveness by applying it to the downstream secondary/3D structure prediction, SARS-CoV-2 genome structure and evolution prediction, protein-RNA binding preference modeling, and gene expression regulation modeling. The comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method improves the RNA structural and functional modelling results significantly and consistently. Despite only being trained with unlabelled data, RNA-FM can serve as the foundational model for the field.},

	abstract = {In the canonical genetic code, many amino acids are assigned more than one codon. Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models’ ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cellbased model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons.},

Even small proteins or peptides can be encoded by an enormously large number of mRNAs. The actual mRNA sequence can have a large impact on several properties including expression, stability, immunogenicity, and more. To enable the selection of an optimal sequence, we developed CodonBERT, a large language model (LLM) for mRNAs. Unlike prior models, CodonBERT uses codons as inputs which enables it to learn better representations. CodonBERT was trained using more than 10 million mRNA sequences from a diverse set of organisms. The resulting model captures important biological concepts. CodonBERT can also be extended to perform prediction tasks for various mRNA properties. CodonBERT outperforms previous mRNA prediction methods including on a new flu vaccine dataset.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become increasingly popular to identify associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypic traits. The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses.
METHODS: We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/). In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual-level scores of genetic risk.
RESULTS: The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands-on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users.
CONCLUSIONS: By providing theoretical background and hands-on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

	abstract = {Genetic prediction of complex traits, enabled by large-scale genomic studies, has created new measures to understand individual genetic predisposition. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) offer a way to aggregate information across the genome, enabling personalized risk prediction for complex traits and diseases. However, conventional PRS calculation methods that rely on linear models are limited in their ability to capture complex patterns and interaction effects in high-dimensional genomic data. In this study, we seek to improve the predictive power of PRS through applying advanced deep learning techniques. We show that the Variational AutoEncoder-based model for PRS construction (VAE-PRS) outperforms currently state-of-the-art methods for biobank-level data in 14 out of 16 blood cell traits, while being computationally efficient. Through comprehensive experiments, we found that the VAE-PRS model offers the ability to capture interaction effects in high-dimensional data and shows robust performance across different pre-screened variant sets. Furthermore, VAE-PRS is easily interpretable via assessing the contribution of each individual marker to the final prediction score through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, providing potential new insights in identifying trait-associated genetic variants. In summary, VAE-PRS presents a novel measure to genetic risk prediction by harnessing the power of deep learning methods, which could further facilitate the development of personalized medicine and genetic research.},

	abstract = {The recent proliferation of large scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has motivated the development of statistical methods for phenotype prediction using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data. These polygenic risk score (PRS) methods formulate the task of polygenic prediction in terms of a multiple linear regression framework, where the goal is to infer the joint effect sizes of all genetic variants on the trait. Among the subset of PRS methods that operate on GWAS summary statistics, sparse Bayesian methods have shown competitive predictive ability. However, existing Bayesian approaches employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for posterior inference, which are computationally inefficient and do not scale favorably with the number of SNPs included in the analysis. Here, we introduce Variational Inference of Polygenic Risk Scores (VIPRS), a Bayesian summary statistics-based PRS method that utilizes Variational Inference (VI) techniques to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution for the effect sizes. Our experiments with genome-wide simulations and real phenotypes from the UK Biobank (UKB) dataset demonstrated that variational approximations to the posterior are competitively accurate and highly efficient. When compared to state-of-the-art PRS methods, VIPRS consistently achieves the best or second best predictive accuracy in our analyses of 18 simulation configurations as well as 12 real phenotypes measured among the UKB participants of “White British” background. This performance advantage was higher among individuals from other ethnic groups, with an increase in R2 of up to 1.7-fold among participants of Nigerian ancestry for Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Furthermore, given its computational efficiency, we applied VIPRS to a dataset of up to 10 million genetic markers, an order of magnitude greater than the standard HapMap3 subset used to train existing PRS methods. Modeling this expanded set of variants conferred modest improvements in prediction accuracy for a number of highly polygenic traits, such as standing height.},

	abstract = {Genomic prediction (GP) uses single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to establish associations between markers and phenotypes. Selection of early individuals by genomic estimated breeding value shortens the generation interval and speeds up the breeding process. Recently, methods based on deep learning (DL) have gained great attention in the field of GP. In this study, we explore the application of Transformer-based structures to GP and develop a novel deep-learning model named GPformer. GPformer obtains a global view by gleaning beneficial information from all relevant SNPs regardless of the physical distance between SNPs. Comprehensive experimental results on five different crop datasets show that GPformer outperforms ridge regression-based linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP), support vector regression (SVR), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) and deep neural network genomic prediction (DNNGP) in terms of mean absolute error, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and the proposed metric consistent index. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-guided module (KGM) to extract genome-wide association studies-based information, which is fused into GPformer as prior knowledge. KGM is very flexible and can be plugged into any DL network. Ablation studies of KGM on three datasets illustrate the efficiency of KGM adequately. Moreover, GPformer is robust and stable to hyperparameters and can generalize to each phenotype of every dataset, which is suitable for practical application scenarios.},

Being high dimensional, incorporation of such data in one model is a challenge, often leading to one-dimensional studies and, therefore, information loss. Instead, we first propose relying on non-fixed sets of whole genome or whole exome variant-associated sequences, which can be used for supervised learning of oncology-relevant tasks by our Set Transformer based Deep Neural Network, SetQuence. We optimise this architecture to improve its efficiency. This allows for exploration of not just coding but also non-coding variants, from large datasets. Second, we extend the model to incorporate these representations together with multiple other sources of omics data in a flexible way with SetOmic. Evaluation, using these representations, shows improved robustness and reduced information loss compared to previous approaches, while still being computationally tractable. By means of Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods, our models are able to recapitulate the biological contribution of highly attributed features in the tumours studied. This validation opens the door to novel directions in multi-faceted genome and exome wide biomarker discovery and personalised treatment among other presently clinically relevant tasks.},

More elaborate methods, such as epistasis-aware models, typically struggle with the scale of GWAS data. In this paper, we build on recent advances in neural networks employing Transformer-based architectures to enable such models at a large scale. As a first step towards replacing linear GWAS with a more expressive approximation, we demonstrate prediction of gout, a painful form of inflammatory arthritis arising when monosodium urate crystals form in the joints under high serum urate conditions, from Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) using a scalable (long input) variant of the Transformer architecture. Furthermore, we show that sparse SNVs can be efficiently used by these Transformer-based networks without expanding them to a full genome. By appropriately encoding SNVs, we are able to achieve competitive initial performance, with an AUROC of 83\% when classifying a balanced test set using genotype and demographic information. Moreover, the confidence with which the network makes its prediction is a good indication of the prediction accuracy. Our results indicate a number of opportunities for extension, enabling full genome-scale data analysis using more complex and accurate genotype-phenotype association models.},

As proof-of-concept, we use G2PT to model the genetics of TG/HDL (triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), an indicator of metabolic health. G2PT predicts this trait via attention to 1,395 variants underlying at least 20 systems, including immune response and cholesterol transport, with accuracy exceeding state-of-the-art. It implicates 40 epistatic interactions, including epistasis between APOA4 and CETP in phospholipid transfer, a target pathway for cholesterol modification.

	abstract = {Decoding the linguistic intricacies of the genome is a crucial problem in biology, and pre-trained foundational models such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer have made significant strides in this area. Existing works have largely hinged on k-mer, fixed-length permutations of A, T, C, and G, as the token of the genome language due to its simplicity. However, we argue that the computation and sample inefficiencies introduced by k-mer tokenization are primary obstacles in developing large genome foundational models. We provide conceptual and empirical insights into genome tokenization, building on which we propose to replace k-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a statistics-based data compression algorithm that constructs tokens by iteratively merging the most frequent co-occurring genome segment in the corpus. We demonstrate that BPE not only overcomes the limitations of k-mer tokenization but also benefits from the computational efficiency of non-overlapping tokenization. Based on these insights, we introduce DNABERT-2, a refined genome foundation model that adapts an efficient tokenizer and employs multiple strategies to overcome input length constraints, reduce time and memory expenditure, and enhance model capability. Furthermore, we identify the absence of a comprehensive and standardized benchmark for genome understanding as another significant impediment to fair comparative analysis. In response, we propose the Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE), a comprehensive multi-species genome classification dataset that amalgamates \$36\$ distinct datasets across \$9\$ tasks, with input lengths ranging from \$70\$ to \$10000\$. Through comprehensive experiments on the GUE benchmark, we demonstrate that DNABERT-2 achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model with \$21 {\textbackslash}times\$ fewer parameters and approximately \$92 {\textbackslash}times\$ less GPU time in pre-training.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has made strides in modeling protein sequences but often struggles to generalize beyond its training distribution. Current models focus on learning individual sequences through masked language modeling, but effective protein sequence analysis demands the ability to reason across sequences, a critical step in phylogenetic analysis. Training biological foundation models explicitly for intersequence reasoning could enhance their generalizability and performance for phylogenetic inference and other tasks in computational biology. Here, we report an ongoing development of Phyla, an architecture that operates on an explicit, higher-level semantic representation of phylogenetic trees. Phyla employs a hybrid state-space transformer architecture and a novel tree loss function to achieve state-of-the-art performance on sequence reasoning benchmarks and phylogenetic tree reconstruction. To validate Phyla's capabilities, we applied it to reconstruct the tree of life, where Phyla accurately reclassified archaeal organisms, such as Lokiarchaeota, as more closely related to bacteria-aligning with recent phylogenetic insights. Phyla represents a step toward molecular sequence reasoning, emphasizing structured reasoning over memorization and advancing protein sequence analysis and phylogenetic inference.},

	abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease involving symmetric joints and is generally characterized by persistent pain, tenderness, and destruction of joints. The vast majority of RA patients produce autoantibodies, and immune cell involvement in disease development is well recognized, as is the contribution of other types of cells in synovial tissue, like fibroblasts. It is known that there are major genetic associations with the HLA locus, while multiple non-HLA genetic variants display relatively low risk of RA. Both HLA and non-HLA associations suggest that the profiles of genetic associations for autoantibody-positive vs. autoantibody-negative RA are different. Several alleles of HLA-DRB1 are associated with high risk for autoantibody-positive RA, with the strongest risk characterized by valine at position 11 of the protein sequence (HLA-DRB1*04 and *10 alleles). There is a strong protective effect for the risk of autoantibody-positive RA associated with HLA-DRB1*13 alleles. Although major genetic associations have been known for several years, understanding of the specific mechanisms in the development of increased risk of RA for these variations is work in progress. Current studies focus on the binding of immune receptors involved in recognition of putative peptides in activation of T cells, as well as investigation of cell signaling mechanisms. At least a part of RA risk could be explained by gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. There are currently more than 150 candidate loci with polymorphisms that associate with RA, mainly related to seropositive disease, and new discoveries are anticipated in the future from investigation of diverse human populations. This new research will help create a strong foundation for the continuing process of integrating genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data in studies of RA.},

A region of particular interest is the protein-coding part of the genome, or exome, which is composed of gene exons. The principles of exome purification and sequencing will be described in this review, as well as analyses of the data generated. Results will be discussed in terms of their possible functional and clinical significance. The advantages and limitations of exome sequencing will be compared to those of other massive sequencing approaches such as whole-genome sequencing, ribonucleic acid sequencing or selected DNA sequencing. Exome sequencing has been used recently in the study of various diseases. Monogenic diseases with Mendelian inheritance are among these, but studies have also been carried out on genetic variations that represent risk factors for complex diseases. Cancer is another intensive area for exome sequencing studies. Several examples of the use of exome sequencing in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of these diseases will be described. Finally, remaining challenges and some practical and ethical considerations for the clinical application of exome sequencing will be discussed.Keywords: massively parallel sequencing, RNA sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, genetic variants, molecular diagnosis, pharmacogenomics, personalized medicine, NGS, SGS, SNP, SNV},

By modelling the 3D structures of the correspond protein complexes valuable insights can be obtained, providing, e.g. starting points for drug and protein design. One challenge in the modelling process is however the identification of near-native models from the large pool of generated models. To this end we have previously developed DeepRank-GNN, a graph neural network that integrates structural and sequence information to enable effective pattern learning at PPI interfaces. Its main features are related to the Position Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs), which are computationally expensive to generate, significantly limits the algorithm's usability.We introduce here DeepRank-GNN-esm that includes as additional features protein language model embeddings from the ESM-2 model. We show that the ESM-2 embeddings can actually replace the PSSM features at no cost in-, or even better performance on two PPI-related tasks: scoring docking poses and detecting crystal artifacts. This new DeepRank version bypasses thus the need of generating PSSM, greatly improving the usability of the software and opening new application opportunities for systems for which PSSM profiles cannot be obtained or are irrelevant (e.g. antibody-antigen complexes).DeepRank-GNN-esm is freely available from https://github.com/DeepRank/DeepRank-GNN-esm.},

CGMega outperforms current approaches in cancer gene prediction, and it provides a promising approach to integrate multi-omics information. We apply CGMega to breast cancer cell line and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and we uncover the high-order gene module formed by ErbB family and tumor factors NRG1, PPM1A and DLG2. We identify 396 candidate AML genes, and observe the enrichment of either known AML genes or candidate AML genes in a single gene module. We also identify patient-specific AML genes and associated gene modules. Together, these results indicate that CGMega can be used to dissect cancer gene modules, and provide high-order mechanistic insights into cancer development and heterogeneity.},

However, most existing approaches require that all nodes in the graph are present during training of the embeddings; these previous approaches are inherently transductive and do not naturally generalize to unseen nodes. Here we present GraphSAGE, a general, inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, we learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a node's local neighborhood. Our algorithm outperforms strong baselines on three inductive node-classification benchmarks: we classify the category of unseen nodes in evolving information graphs based on citation and Reddit post data, and we show that our algorithm generalizes to completely unseen graphs using a multi-graph dataset of protein-protein interactions.},

LINGER incorporates atlas-scale external bulk data across diverse cellular contexts and prior knowledge of transcription factor motifs as a manifold regularization. LINGER achieves a fourfold to sevenfold relative increase in accuracy over existing methods and reveals a complex regulatory landscape of genome-wide association studies, enabling enhanced interpretation of disease-associated variants and genes. Following the GRN inference from reference single-cell multiome data, LINGER enables the estimation of transcription factor activity solely from bulk or single-cell gene expression data, leveraging the abundance of available gene expression data to identify driver regulators from case-control studies.},

The massive growth in demand and cost associated with experimental PPI studies calls for computational tools for automated prediction and understanding of PPIs. Despite recent progress, in silico methods remain inadequate in modeling the natural PPI hierarchy. Here we present a double-viewed hierarchical graph learning model, HIGH-PPI, to predict PPIs and extrapolate the molecular details involved. In this model, we create a hierarchical graph, in which a node in the PPI network (top outside-of-protein view) is a protein graph (bottom inside-of-protein view). In the bottom view, a group of chemically relevant descriptors, instead of the protein sequences, are used to better capture the structure-function relationship of the protein. HIGH-PPI examines both outside-of-protein and inside-of-protein of the human interactome to establish a robust machine understanding of PPIs. This model demonstrates high accuracy and robustness in predicting PPIs. Moreover, HIGH-PPI can interpret the modes of action of PPIs by identifying important binding and catalytic sites precisely. Overall, “HIGH-PPI [https://github.com/zqgao22/HIGH-PPI]” is a domain-knowledge-driven and interpretable framework for PPI prediction studies.},

	abstract = {While next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed genetic testing, it generates large quantities of noisy data that require a significant amount of bioinformatics to generate useful interpretation. The accuracy of variant calling is therefore critical. Although GATK HaplotypeCaller is a widely used tool for this purpose, newer methods such as DeepVariant have shown higher accuracy in assessments of gold-standard samples for whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES), but a side-by-side comparison on clinical samples has not been performed. Trio WES was used to compare GATK (4.1.2.0) HaplotypeCaller and DeepVariant (v0.8.0). The performance of the two pipelines was evaluated according to the Mendelian error rate, transition-to-transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio, concordance rate, and pathological variant detection rate. Data from 80 trios were analyzed. The Mendelian error rate of the 77 biological trios calculated from the data by DeepVariant (3.09 ± 0.83\%) was lower than that calculated from the data by GATK (5.25 ± 0.91\%) (p {\textless} 0.001). DeepVariant also yielded a higher Ti/Tv ratio (2.38 ± 0.02) than GATK (2.04 ± 0.07) (p {\textless} 0.001), suggesting that DeepVariant proportionally called more true positives. The concordance rate between the 2 pipelines was 88.73\%. Sixty-three disease-causing variants were detected in the 80 trios. Among them, DeepVariant detected 62 variants, and GATK detected 61 variants. The one variant called by DeepVariant but not GATK HaplotypeCaller might have been missed by GATK HaplotypeCaller due to low coverage. OTC exon 2 (139 bp) deletion was not detected by either method. Mendelian error rate calculation is an effective way to evaluate variant callers. By this method, DeepVariant outperformed GATK, while the two pipelines performed equally in other parameters.},

	abstract = {A large number of real-world networks include multiple types of nodes and edges. Graph Neural Network (GNN) emerged as a deep learning framework to generate node and graph embeddings for downstream machine learning tasks. However, popular GNN-based architectures operate on single homogeneous networks. Enabling them to work on multiple networks brings additional challenges due to the heterogeneity of the networks and the multiplicity of the existing associations. In this study, we present a computational approach named GRAF (Graph Attention-aware Fusion Networks) utilizing GNN-based approaches on multiple networks with the help of attention mechanisms and network fusion. Using attention-based neighborhood aggregation, GRAF learns the importance of each neighbor per node (called node-level attention) followed by the importance of association (called association-level attention). Then, GRAF processes a network fusion step weighing each edge according to learned node- and association-level attentions. Considering that the fused network could be a highly dense network with many weak edges depending on the given input networks, we included an edge elimination step with respect to edges' weights. Finally, GRAF utilizes Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on the fused network and incorporates node features on graph-structured data for a node classification or a similar downstream task. To demonstrate GRAF's generalizability, we applied it to four datasets from different domains and observed that GRAF outperformed or was on par with the baselines, state-of-the-art methods, and its own variations for each node classification task.

	abstract = {DNA sequence alignment, an important genomic task, involves assigning short DNA reads to the most probable locations on an extensive reference genome. Conventional methods tackle this challenge in two steps: genome indexing followed by efficient search to locate likely positions for given reads. Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLM) in encoding text into embeddings, where the distance metric captures semantic similarity, recent efforts have encoded DNA sequences into vectors using Transformers and have shown promising results in tasks involving classification of short DNA sequences. Performance at sequence classification tasks does not, however, guarantee sequence alignment, where it is necessary to conduct a genome-wide search to align every read successfully, a significantly longer-range task by comparison. We bridge this gap by developing a “Embed-Search-Align” (ESA) framework, where a novel Reference-Free DNA Embedding (RDE ) Transformer model generates vector embeddings of reads and fragments of the reference in a shared vector space; read-fragment distance metric is then used as a surrogate for sequence similarity. ESA introduces: (1) Contrastive loss for self-supervised training of DNA sequence representations, facilitating rich reference-free, sequence-level embeddings, and (2) a DNA vector store to enable search across fragments on a global scale. RDE is 99\% accurate when aligning 250-length reads onto a human reference genome of 3 gigabases (single-haploid), rivaling conventional algorithmic sequence alignment methods such as Bowtie and BWA-Mem. RDE far exceeds the performance of 6 recent DNATransformer model baselines such as Nucleotide Transformer, Hyena-DNA, and shows task transfer across chromosomes and species.},

While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features.

Additionally, a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating tasks reliant on long-range dependencies is notably absent. To address this gap, we introduce DNALONGBENCH, a benchmark dataset spanning five important genomics tasks that consider long-range dependencies up to 1 million base pairs: enhancer-target gene interaction, expression quantitative trait loci, 3D genome organization, regulatory sequence activity, and transcription initiation signal. To comprehensively assess DNALONGBENCH, we evaluate the performance of five baseline methods: a task-specific expert model, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model, and three fine-tuned DNA foundation models -- HyenaDNA, Caduceus-Ph and Caduceus-PS. We envision DNALONGBENCH having the potential to become a standardized resource that facilitates comprehensive comparisons and rigorous evaluations of emerging DNA sequence-based deep learning models that consider long-range dependencies.},

Here, we present the Human Genomics Long-Range Benchmark (LRB), which focuses on biologically meaningful tasks and supports long-range contexts. We complement our benchmark with fine-tuning recipes that meaningfully improve performance and affect model evaluation. We evaluate DNA LMs across nine compiled human genome tasks and observe that DNA LMs achieve competitive performance relative to supervised baselines on several tasks (e.g., genome annotation), but there remains a significant gap in domains, such as variant effect and gene expression prediction. Additionally, we introduce a visualization tool to examine model performance split by various genomic properties.

	abstract = {Genetic variants (GVs) are defined as differences in the DNA sequences among individuals and play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating genetic diseases. The rapid decrease in next generation sequencing cost has led to an exponential increase in patient-level GV data. This growth poses a challenge for clinicians who must efficiently prioritize patient-specific GVs and integrate them with existing genomic databases to inform patient management. To addressing the interpretation of GVs, genomic foundation models (GFMs) have emerged. However, these models lack standardized performance assessments, leading to considerable variability in model evaluations. This poses the question: How effectively do deep learning methods classify unknown GVs and align them with clinically-verified GVs? We argue that representation learning, which transforms raw data into meaningful feature spaces, is an effective approach for addressing both indexing and classification challenges. We introduce a large-scale Genetic Variant dataset, named GV-Rep, featuring variable-length contexts and detailed annotations, designed for deep learning models to learn GV representations across various traits, diseases, tissue types, and experimental contexts. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) Construction of a comprehensive dataset with 7 million records, each labeled with characteristics of the corresponding variants, alongside additional data from 17,548 gene knockout tests across 1,107 cell types, 1,808 variant combinations, and 156 unique clinically verified GVs from real-world patients. (ii) Analysis of the structure and properties of the dataset. (iii) Experimentation of the dataset with pre-trained GFMs. The results show a significant gap between GFMs current capabilities and accurate GV representation. We hope this dataset will help advance genomic deep learning to bridge this gap.},

In many diseases, HLA explains more heritability than all other known loci combined. In silico HLA imputation methods enable rapid and accurate estimation of HLA alleles in the millions of individuals that are already genotyped on microarrays. HLA imputation has been used to define causal variation in autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, and in human immunodeficiency virus infection control. However, there are few guidelines on performing HLA imputation, association testing, and fine mapping. Here, we present a comprehensive tutorial to impute HLA alleles from genotype data. We provide detailed guidance on performing standard quality control measures for input genotyping data and describe options to impute HLA alleles and amino acids either locally or using the web-based Michigan Imputation Server, which hosts a multi-ancestry HLA imputation reference panel. We also offer best practice recommendations to conduct association tests to define the alleles, amino acids, and haplotypes that affect human traits. Along with the pipeline, we provide a step-by-step online guide with scripts and available software (https://github.com/immunogenomics/HLA\_analyses\_tutorial).

These polymorphisms have been linked to several diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to compare the frequency and association of VDR ApaI and BsmI gene polymorphisms, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-(OH)-D) levels, and calcium (Ca) levels between a RA group and a matched healthy control group. In one hundred RA patients and fifty healthy controls, the genotypes of the VDR ApaI and BsmI gene polymorphisms were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP). Both Serum 25-(OH)-D level and calcium level were measured in the two groups. There was no significant difference between the cases and controls regarding the VDR ApaI gene polymorphism (p = 0.89). A significant difference was observed between the cases and controls in terms of the VDR BsmI gene polymorphism (p = {\textless} 0.001). The serum levels of 25-(OH)-D and calcium were significantly lower in the RA group compared to the control group (p = 0.04 and {\textless} 0.001 respectively). Significantly higher serum vitamin D levels were associated with the aa genotype (p = 0.007). Significantly increased calcium levels were associated with the AA genotype (p = 0.02). No significant difference was found among BsmI polymorphisms regarding vitamin D and Ca levels (p = 0.25 and 0.87 respectively). Vitamin D receptor gene BsmI polymorphism but not ApaI polymorphism could be a marker of RA susceptibility. Vitamin D and Ca levels are negatively affected by RA. Vitamin D receptor gene ApaI polymorphism contributes to vitamin D and Ca levels.},

	abstract = {Background
In recent years, mounting evidence has indicated a co-morbid relationship between hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), however, the shared genetic factors underlying this association remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the common genetic architecture between hypothyroidism and RA.
Methods
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from recently published studies were utilized to examine the genetic correlation, shared genetic loci, and potential causal relationship between hypothyroidism and RA. Statistical methods included linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), high-definition likelihood (HDL), cross-trait meta-analyses, colocalization analysis, multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA), tissue-specific enrichment analysis (TSEA), functional enrichment analysis, and latent causal variable method (LCV).
Results
Our study demonstrated a significant genetic correlation between hypothyroidism and RA(LDSC:rg=0.3803,p=7.23e-11;HDL:rg=0.3849,p=1.02e-21). Through cross-trait meta-analysis, we identified 1035 loci, including 43 novel genetic loci. By integrating colocalization analysis and the MAGMA algorithm, we found a substantial number of genes, such as PTPN22, TYK2, and CTLA-4, shared between the two diseases, which showed significant enrichment across 14 tissues. These genes were primarily associated with the regulation of alpha-beta T cell proliferation, positive regulation of T cell activation, positive regulation of leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, T cell receptor signaling pathway, and JAK-STAT signaling pathway. However, our study did not reveal a significant causal association between the two diseases using the LCV approach.
Conclusion
Based on these findings, there is a significant genetic correlation between hypothyroidism and RA, suggesting a shared genetic basis for these conditions.},

	abstract = {Background
Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a 2‐ to 10‐fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the biological mechanisms and existence of causality underlying such associations remain to be investigated. We aimed to investigate the genetic associations and underlying mechanisms between RA and CVD by leveraging large‐scale genomic data and genetic cross‐trait analytic approaches.
Methods and Results
Within UK Biobank data, we examined the genetic correlation, shared genetics, and potential causality between RA (Ncases=6754, Ncontrols=452 384) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD, Ncases=44 238, Ncontrols=414 900) using linkage disequilibrium score regression, cross‐trait meta‐analysis, and Mendelian randomization. We observed significant genetic correlations of RA with myocardial infarction (rg:0.40 [95\% CI, 0.24–0.56), angina (rg:0.42 [95\% CI, 0.28–0.56]), coronary heart diseases (rg:0.41 [95\% CI, 0.27–0.55]), and CVD (rg:0.43 [95\% CI, 0.29–0.57]) after correcting for multiple testing (P{\textless}0.05/5). When stratified by frequent use of analgesics, we found increased genetic correlation between RA and CVD among participants without aspirin usage (rg:0.54 [95\% CI, 0.30–0.78] for angina; Pvalue=6.69×10−6) and among participants with paracetamol usage (rg:0.75 [95\% CI, 0.20–1.29] for myocardial infarction; Pvalue=8.90×10−3), whereas others remained similar. Cross‐trait meta‐analysis identified 9 independent shared loci between RA and CVD, including PTPN22 at chr1p13.2, BCL2L11 at chr2q13, and CCR3 at chr3p21.31 (Psingle trait{\textless}1×10−3 and Pmeta{\textless}5×10−8), highlighting potential shared pathogenesis including accelerating atherosclerosis, upregulating oxidative stress, and vascular permeability. Finally, Mendelian randomization estimates showed limited evidence of causality between RA and CVD.
Conclusions
Our results supported shared genetic pathogenesis rather than causality in explaining the observed association between RA and CVD. The identified shared genetic factors provided insights into potential novel therapeutic target for RA‐CVD comorbidities.},

	abstract = {Latin America continues to be severely underrepresented in genomics research, and fine-scale genetic histories and complex trait architectures remain hidden owing to insufficient data1. To fill this gap, the Mexican Biobank project genotyped 6,057 individuals from 898 rural and urban localities across all 32 states in Mexico at a resolution of 1.8 million genome-wide markers with linked complex trait and disease information creating a valuable nationwide genotype–phenotype database. Here, using ancestry deconvolution and inference of identity-by-descent segments, we inferred ancestral population sizes across Mesoamerican regions over time, unravelling Indigenous, colonial and postcolonial demographic dynamics2–6. We observed variation in runs of homozygosity among genomic regions with different ancestries reflecting distinct demographic histories and, in turn, different distributions of rare deleterious variants. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 22 complex traits and found that several traits are better predicted using the Mexican Biobank GWAS compared to the UK Biobank GWAS7,8. We identified genetic and environmental factors associating with trait variation, such as the length of the genome in runs of homozygosity as a predictor for body mass index, triglycerides, glucose and height. This study provides insights into the genetic histories of individuals in Mexico and dissects their complex trait architectures, both crucial for making precision and preventive medicine initiatives accessible worldwide.},

To produce risk estimates relevant to clinical and public health decision-making, it is important to account for varying effects due to age and sex. Here, we develop a novel framework to estimate country-, age-, and sex-specific estimates of cumulative incidence stratified by PGS for 18 high-burden diseases. We integrate PGS associations from seven studies in four countries (N = 1,197,129) with disease incidences from the Global Burden of Disease. PGS has a significant sex-specific effect for asthma, hip osteoarthritis, gout, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes (T2D), with all but T2D exhibiting a larger effect in men. PGS has a larger effect in younger individuals for 13 diseases, with effects decreasing linearly with age. We show for breast cancer that, relative to individuals in the bottom 20\% of polygenic risk, the top 5\% attain an absolute risk for screening eligibility 16.3 years earlier. Our framework increases the generalizability of results from biobank studies and the accuracy of absolute risk estimates by appropriately accounting for age- and sex-specific PGS effects. Our results highlight the potential of PGS as a screening tool which may assist in the early prevention of common diseases.},

	abstract = {Background:
Evidence for a potential link between air pollution and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is inconsistent, and the modified effect of genetic susceptibility on the relationship between air pollution and RA has not been well studied.
Objective:
Using a general population cohort from the UK Biobank, this study aimed to investigate the associations between various air pollutants and the risk of incident RA and to further estimate the impact of combined exposure to ambient air pollutants on the risk of developing RA under the modification effect of genetic predisposition.
Methods:
A total of 342,973 participants with completed genotyping data and who were free of RA at baseline were included in the study. An air pollution score was constructed by summing the concentrations of each pollutant weighted by the regression coefficients with RA from single-pollutant models to assess the combined effect of air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) with diameters ≤2.5μ⁢m (PM2.5), between 2.5 and 10μ⁢m (PM2.5–10), and ≤10μ⁢m (PM10), as well as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). In addition, the polygenic risk score (PRS) of RA was calculated to characterize individual genetic risk. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) of associations of single air pollutant, air pollution score, or PRS with incident RA.
Results:
During a median follow-up time of 8.1 y, 2,034 incident events of RA were recorded. The HRs (95\% CIs) of incident RA per interquartile range increment in PM2.5, PM2.5–10, PM10, NO2, and NOx were 1.07 (1.01, 1.13), 1.00 (0.96, 1.04), 1.01 (0.96, 1.07), 1.03 (0.98, 1.09), and 1.07 (1.02, 1.12), respectively. We also found a positive exposure–response relationship between air pollution score and RA risk (𝑝Trend=0.000053). The HR (95\% CI) of incident RA was 1.14 (1.00, 1.29) in the highest quartile group compared with the lowest quartile group of the air pollution score. Furthermore, the results of the combined effect of air pollution score and PRS on the RA risk showed that the risk of RA incidence in the highest genetic risk and air pollution score group was almost twice that of the lowest genetic risk and air pollution score group [incidence rate (IR) per 100,000 person-years: 98.46 vs. 51.19, and HR= 1.73 (95\% CI: 1.39, 2.17) vs. 1 (reference)], although no statistically significant interaction between the air pollution and genetic risk for incident RA was found (𝑝Interaction{\textgreater}0.05).
Discussion:
The results revealed that long-term combined exposure to ambient air pollutants might increase the risk of RA, particularly in those with high genetic risk. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10710},

	abstract = {Dominance heritability in complex traits has received increasing recognition. However, most polygenic score (PGS) approaches do not incorporate non-additive effects. Here, we present GenoBoost, a flexible PGS modeling framework capable of considering both additive and non-additive effects, specifically focusing on genetic dominance. Building on statistical boosting theory, we derive provably optimal GenoBoost scores and provide its efficient implementation for analyzing large-scale cohorts. We benchmark it against seven commonly used PGS methods and demonstrate its competitive predictive performance. GenoBoost is ranked the best for four traits and second-best for three traits among twelve tested disease outcomes in UK Biobank. We reveal that GenoBoost improves prediction for autoimmune diseases by incorporating non-additive effects localized in the MHC locus and, more broadly, works best in less polygenic traits. We further demonstrate that GenoBoost can infer the mode of genetic inheritance without requiring prior knowledge. For example, GenoBoost finds non-zero genetic dominance effects for 602 of 900 selected genetic variants, resulting in 2.5\% improvements in predicting psoriasis cases. Lastly, we show that GenoBoost can prioritize genetic loci with genetic dominance not previously reported in the GWAS catalog. Our results highlight the increased accuracy and biological insights from incorporating non-additive effects in PGS models.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate whether polygenic risk scores obtained using data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility can be predictors of radiographic progression. Methods We constructed polygenic risk scores using GWAS summary data on associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms with RA susceptibility. The polygenic risk scores were stratified into quintiles based on levels of significance (ranging from top quintile of polygenic risk scores to bottom quintile). In addition, change in the Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) of radiographic progression over the first 5 years after onset of RA was assessed. The change in SHS over 5 years was stratified according to quartiles, with the top quartile of change in SHS defined as severe radiographic progression (score change of {\textgreater}35 points) and the remaining 3 quartiles defined as nonsevere radiographic progression. Polygenic risk scores were assessed for their ability to predict the SHS status over 5 years in a training set (n = 500 RA patients) for selection of the best model, and in a testing set (n = 740 RA patients) for validation of the data. We evaluated the performance of the polygenic risk score as a predictor of severe radiographic progression in univariable and multivariable analyses with inclusion of other factors. Results Polygenic risk scores constructed from 43,784 single-nucleotide polymorphisms significantly differed between patients who experienced severe radiographic progression and those with nonsevere radiographic progression in both the training set (P = 0.0064) and the testing set (P = 0.017). Patients with polygenic risk scores in the top quintile had a higher risk of severe progression compared to those with polygenic risk scores in the bottom quintile (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, P = 0.0022), and the risk of severe radiographic progression was even higher when restricted to patients who were younger at disease onset (OR 5.06, P = 0.00038). The group with polygenic risk scores in the top quintile and the anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA)–positive group had significantly higher proportions of patients with severe radiographic progression (P = 0.00052 and P = 0.0022, respectively) compared to the remaining groups. Multivariable analysis showed that polygenic risk score (P = 0.00019) as well as female sex (P = 0.0033), ACPA positivity (P = 0.0023), and body mass index (P = 0.024) were independent risk factors for severe radiographic progression. Conclusion A polygenic risk score that is derived from GWAS data on RA susceptibility is associated with the level of severity of radiographic progression in patients with RA.},

The open resource is unique in its size and scope. A rich variety of phenotypic and health-related information is available on each participant, including biological measurements, lifestyle indicators, biomarkers in blood and urine, and imaging of the body and brain. Follow-up information is provided by linking health and medical records. Genome-wide genotype data have been collected on all participants, providing many opportunities for the discovery of new genetic associations and the genetic bases of complex traits. Here we describe the centralized analysis of the genetic data, including genotype quality, properties of population structure and relatedness of the genetic data, and efficient phasing and genotype imputation that increases the number of testable variants to around 96 million. Classical allelic variation at 11 human leukocyte antigen genes was imputed, resulting in the recovery of signals with known associations between human leukocyte antigen alleles and many diseases.},

	abstract = {Population isolates such as those in Finland benefit genetic research because deleterious alleles are often concentrated on a small number of low-frequency variants (0.1\% ≤ minor allele frequency {\textless} 5\%). These variants survived the founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored1,2. FinnGen aims to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63 years) and the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS), P {\textless} 2.6 × 10–11) at 2,496 (771 PWS) independent loci with 807 (247 PWS) end points. Among these, fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of {\textless}5\% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants.},

The current number of participants—close to 52000-—represents a large proportion, 5\%, of the Estonian adult population, making it ideally suited to population-based studies. General practitioners (GPs) and medical personnel in the special recruitment offices have recruited participants throughout the country. At baseline, the GPs performed a standardized health examination of the participants, who also donated blood samples for DNA, white blood cells and plasma tests and filled out a 16-module questionnaire on health-related topics such as lifestyle, diet and clinical diagnoses described in WHO ICD-10. A significant part of the cohort has whole genome sequencing (100), genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data (20 000) and/or NMR metabolome data (11 000) available (http://www.geenivaramu.ee/for-scientists/data-release/). The data are continuously updated through periodical linking to national electronic databases and registries. A part of the cohort has been re-contacted for follow-up purposes and resampling, and targeted invitations are possible for specific purposes, for example people with a specific diagnosis.

	abstract = {Here the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium presents a first draft of the human pangenome reference. The pangenome contains 47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically diverse individuals1. These assemblies cover more than 99\% of the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99\% accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles at structurally complex loci. We also add 119 million base pairs of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation. Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced small variant discovery errors by 34\% and increased the number of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104\% compared with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.},

These genomes include at least 5.8 million base pairs that are not present in the human reference genome. Our analysis reveals key features of the landscape of human genome variation, including that the rate of accumulation of mutations has accelerated by about 5\% in non-Africans compared to Africans since divergence. We show that the ancestors of some pairs of present-day human populations were substantially separated by 100,000 years ago, well before the archaeologically attested onset of behavioural modernity. We also demonstrate that indigenous Australians, New Guineans and Andamanese do not derive substantial ancestry from an early dispersal of modern humans; instead, their modern human ancestry is consistent with coming from the same source as that of other non-Africans.},

	abstract = {The Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) programme seeks to elucidate the genetic architecture and biology of heart, lung, blood and sleep disorders, with the ultimate goal of improving diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases. The initial phases of the programme focused on whole-genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here we describe the TOPMed goals and design as well as the available resources and early insights obtained from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation server, and genomic and phenotypic data that are available through dbGaP (Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes)1. In the first 53,831 TOPMed samples, we detected more than 400 million single-nucleotide and insertion or deletion variants after alignment with the reference genome. Additional previously undescribed variants were detected through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the more than 400 million detected variants, 97\% have frequencies of less than 1\% and 46\% are singletons that are present in only one individual (53\% among unrelated individuals). These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The extensive catalogue of genetic variation in TOPMed studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and noncoding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and reach of genome-wide association studies to include variants down to a frequency of approximately 0.01\%.},

	abstract = {Aim: Identifying the predictors of responsiveness and adverse events in methotrexate (MTX) treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been the focus of most concern, but still without consistent consensus. Methods: PubMed and OVID EMBASE were searched to collect relevant studies that addressed correlations between gene polymorphisms and efficacy and/or toxicity in MTX-treated RA patients. Allelic, recessive, dominant and over-dominant model were applied. Results: A total of 68 studies were included. For associations with efficacy, AMPD1 34C{\textgreater}T polymorphism was related to responsiveness in dominant model (odds ratio [OR]: 1.77; 95\% CI: 1.19–2.63) and over-dominant model (OR: 1.59; 95\% CI: 1.04–2.45). ATIC T675C polymorphism had association with responsiveness in recessive model (OR: 2.54; 95\% CI: 1.23–5.26). For associations with toxicity, polymorphisms in TYMS 1494 del6 and FPGS rs10106 were correlated to absenting overall adverse events in recessive model (OR: 0.68; 95\% CI: 0.49–0.95) and dominant model (OR: 0.54; 95\% CI: 0.35–0.83) respectively while MTHFR C677T was associated with presenting overall adverse events in allelic model (OR: 1.29; 95\% CI: 1.02–1.63), recessive model (OR: 1.38; 95\% CI: 1.00–1.89) and dominant model (OR: 1.41; 95\% CI: 1.02–1.94). Conclusion: Polymorphisms in AMPD1 34C{\textgreater}T and ATIC T675C predict responsiveness. The absence of TYMS 1494 del6 and FPGS rs10106 and presence of MTHFR C677T predict adverse events in RA patients treated with MTX. Moreover, variations of the associations were found between Caucasians and non-Caucasians.},

	abstract = {Objective 
          The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with methotrexate (MTX) is linked to the development or progression of rheumatoid nodules. The aim of this study was to determine whether folate and adenosine pathways-related single nucleotide polymorphisms might be predictive of increased nodule formation in RA patients treated with oral MTX.
          Methods 
          A total of 185 Caucasian RA patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study, all of whom fulfilled the 1987 RA criteria of the American College of Rheumatology; each patient had a history of MTX treatment.
          Results 
          A higher frequency of the MTHFR 1298AA genotype was found in 17 (70.8\%) of 24 patients with general nodules [odds ratio (OR)=3.08, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.20–7.69] and in 14 (73.7\%) of 19 patients who developed nodules during MTX treatment (OR=3.55, 95\% CI: 1.22–10.32). In contrast, a negative association with nodules during MTX treatment (OR=0.29, 95\% CI: 0.08–1.10) was found for 19 (79.2\%) patients with the TT genotype (rs2298383) in the adenosine A2a receptor gene (ADORA2A). However, the significance did not remain upon correction for multiple testing. The combination of MTHFR 1298AA along with ADORA2A rs2298383 CC or CT genotypes occurring in one-third of RA patients showed a higher frequency of general nodules 15/59 (25.4\%) as well as developing nodules during MTX treatment 13/59 (22.0\%) in comparison with the overall studied group: 24/185 (13.0\%) and 19/185 (10.3\%), respectively.
          Conclusion 
          This exploratory study indicates for the first time a plausible association of adenosine and folate pathways single nucleotide polymorphisms in nodules’ etiopathogenesis.},

We have used this approach to investigate predictors of methotrexate (MTX)-induced adverse events (AEs) leading to treatment discontinuation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In total, 333 RA patients were genotyped for 34 polymorphisms in MTX transporters, folate and adenosine pathways. The effect of clinical and pharmacogenetic factors was assessed with penalized regression in the cause-specific Cox proportional hazards model. The predictive capacity was evaluated with the area under time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve where cross-validation was applied. SLC19A1, ABCG2, ADORA3 and TYMS were associated with discontinuation because of AEs in clinical–pharmacogenetic model. Cross-validation showed that both clinical–pharmacogenetic model and nongenetic model had worthless predictive ability for MTX discontinuation because of AEs. These models could be further improved, either with additional polymorphisms or with epigenetic predictors.},

However, no genetic biomarker has yet been sufficiently validated. Here, we aimed to replicate a selection of 25 SNPs in the largest collection of patients up to date, which consisted of 915 patients treated with MTX. The change in disease activity (measured as ΔDAS28) from baseline was considered the primary outcome. In addition, response according to widely used criteria (EULAR) was taken as secondary outcome. We considered consistency between outcomes, P values accounting for the number of SNPs, and independence from potential confounders for interpretation of the results. Only the rs1801394 SNP in MTRR fulfilled the high association standards. Its minor allele was associated with less improvement than the major allele according to ΔDAS28 (p = 0.0016), and EULAR response (p = 0.004), with independence of sex, age, baseline DAS28, smoking, seropositivity, concomitant corticosteroid use or previous treatments. In addition, previous evidence suggests the association of this SNP with response to MTX in another autoimmune disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and with high intracellular folate levels, which could contribute to poor response.},

	abstract = {Aim: To study the performance of a clinical pharmacogenetic model for the prediction of nonresponse in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients treated with methotrexate (MTX) in combination with other synthetic or biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs . This prediction model includes gender, smoking status, rheumatoid factor positivity and four genetic variants in AMPD1 (rs17602729), ATIC (rs2372536), ITPA (rs1127354) and MTHFD1 (rs17850560). Methods: A total of 314 RA patients from three Dutch studies were retrospectively included. Eligible patients were adults diagnosed with RA and had a treatment duration with MTX and follow-up for at least two study evaluation visits. Prediction model risk scores at the first and second evaluation were calculated and compared with the actual nonresponse (disease activity score {\textgreater}2.4). Regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses of the prediction model were performed. Also, the sensitivity, specificity and the positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were determined. Results: The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve was 75\% at first and 70\% after second evaluation. At the second evaluation, prediction nonresponse had a sensitivity of 67\% (CI: 54–78\%), specificity of 69\% (CI: 60–77\%), PPV of 52\% (CI: 45–60\%) and NPV of 80\% (CI: 73–85\%). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the clinical pharmacogenetic model has an inadequate performance for the prediction of nonresponse to MTX in RA patients treated with combination therapies.},

	abstract = {Objective: to identify new single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding proteins involved in methotrexate (MTX) metabolism and to evaluate the associations of these SNPs with MTX toxicity or intolerance in a southern Spanish cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: An observational, retrospective, and multicenter study was conducted at three participating hospitals in southern Spain. The main variable was intolerance to MTX (i.e., bDMARD monotherapy), defined as an interruption of treatment due to adverse events or toxicity. Patients being treated with MTX and bDMARDs (combined treatment) at the time of the study visit were considered “tolerant” of MTX. Ten polymorphisms were selected for sequencing in our patients according to a literature review. Each polymorphism was classified according to three possible genotypes (e.g., two homozygous (AA or GG) and one heterozygous (AG)), and the association of these combinations with MTX intolerance was evaluated. Results: A total of 227 patients were included in the final analysis (107 intolerant of MTX and 120 tolerant). A significant association was observed between MTX intolerance and the GGH-T401C AA/AG genotype (OR 2.13, 95\% CI 1.06–4.29) in comparison with the GG genotype. On the other hand, an inverse association was observed between the ABCC2-C24T TT/TC genotype and intolerance to MTX (OR 0.59, 95\% CI 0.35–1.00) in comparison with the CC genotype. Conclusion: This study provides new data on the association between genetic polymorphisms and MTX intolerance, which may contribute to the development of new biomarkers and personalized medicine in patients with RA.},

	abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder that can lead to severe joint damage and is often associated with a high morbidity and disability. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of treatment in RA. DMARDs not only relieve the clinical signs and symptoms of RA but also inhibit the radiographic progression of disease and reduce the effects of chronic systemic inflammation. Since the introduction of biologic DMARDs in the late 1990s, the therapeutic range of options for the management of RA has significantly expanded. However, patients’ response to these agents is not uniform with considerable variability in both efficacy and toxicity. There are no reliable means of predicting an individual patient’s response to a given DMARD prior to initiation of therapy. In this chapter, the current published literature on the pharmacogenetics of traditional DMARDS and the newer biologic DMARDs in RA is highlighted. Pharmacogenetics may help individualize drug therapy in patients with RA by providing reliable biomarkers to predict medication toxicity and efficacy.},

Genetic risk factors may predispose for MTX-DILI. Therefore, we conducted a nested case-control genome-wide association study to explore genetic risk factors associated with MTX-DILI. Seven international groups contributed blood samples and data of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who used MTX. MTX-DILI was defined as an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of at least three times the upper limit of normal (ULN), to increase contrast controls ALT levels did not raise above two times the ULN. Per study site, control subjects and patients with MTX-DILI (ratio 3:1) were matched for age, gender, and duration of MTX use. Patients were genotyped using Illumina GSA MD-24v1-0 and data were imputed using the 1000 Genomes reference panel. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed using an additive genetic model, corrected for sex, country, and age. A P-value of ≤ 5 × 10−8 was considered significant, whereas a P-value of ≤ 5 × 10−6 was considered suggestive. A total of 108 MTX-DILI cases and 311 controls were included for association analysis. None of the SNPs were significantly associated with MTX-DILI. However, we found seven suggestive genetic variants associated with MTX-DILI (P-values 7.43 × 10−8 to 4.86 × 10−6).

	abstract = {Objectives
The usefulness of methotrexate-polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) concentration for management of rheumatoid arthritis has been debated. We aimed to clarify the association of MTX-PGs concentration with efficacy and safety in MTX-naïve patients initiating MTX in a prospective interventional clinical trial.
Methods
The MIRACLE trial enrolled 300 MTX-naïve patients. Oral MTX was initiated and increased to the maximum tolerated dose by week 12. Patients who did not achieve remission according to the Simplified Disease Activity Index at week 24 were randomised to either the continued dose or reduced dose group and were started on subcutaneous adalimumab. We measured the concentrations of MTX-PGs in erythrocytes using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and analysed the association of these concentrations with efficacy and safety.
Results
The mean concentration of total MTX-PGs increased with an increasing dose of MTX and continued to elevate for another 12 weeks after the dose was fixed. At week 24, the total MTX-PGs concentration was 110.5 (SD 43.8) nmol/L with MTX dose of 12.6 (3.0) mg/week (0.23 (0.07) mg/kg/week). During MTX monotherapy, the higher MTX-PGs concentration was an independent factor for lower disease activity; however, this association disappeared after adalimumab initiation in patients with continued MTX dose. Hepatotoxicity was related to the higher MTX-PGs concentration regardless of adalimumab use. The total MTX-PGs concentration was significantly elevated by lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum albumin and body mass index.
Conclusions
The MIRACLE trial demonstrated that higher total MTX-PGs concentration in erythrocytes is related to the higher efficacy and lower safety of MTX.

Recent developments in omics technologies, including single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, provide detailed genomic data alongside tissue histology.

To address this, we developed OmiCLIP, a visual–omics foundation model linking hematoxylin and eosin images and transcriptomics using tissue patches from Visium data. We transformed transcriptomic data into ‘sentences’ by concatenating top-expressed gene symbols from each patch. We curated a dataset of 2.2 million paired tissue images and transcriptomic data across 32 organs to train OmiCLIP integrating histology and transcriptomics. Building on OmiCLIP, our Loki platform offers five key functions: tissue alignment, annotation via bulk RNA sequencing or marker genes, cell-type decomposition, image–transcriptomics retrieval and spatial transcriptomics gene expression prediction from hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Compared with 22 state-of-the-art models on 5 simulations, and 19 public and 4 in-house experimental datasets, Loki demonstrated consistent accuracy and robustness.},

	abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics has become a great source for data-driven insights into biology, enabling the use of advanced deep learning methods to understand cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional regulation at the single-cell level. With the advent of spatial transcriptomics data we have the promise of learning about cells within a tissue context as it provides both spatial coordinates and transcriptomic readouts. However, existing models either ignore spatial resolution or the gene regulatory information. Gene regulation in cells can change depending on microenvironmental cues from neighboring cells, but existing models neglect gene regulatory patterns with hierarchical dependencies across levels of abstraction. In order to create contextualized representations of cells and genes from spatial transcriptomics data, we introduce HEIST, a hierarchical graph transformer-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics and proteomics data. HEIST models tissue as spatial cellular neighborhood graphs, and each cell is, in turn, modeled as a gene regulatory network graph. The framework includes a hierarchical graph transformer that performs cross-level message passing and message passing within levels. HEIST is pre-trained on 22.3M cells from 124 tissues across 15 organs using spatially-aware contrastive learning and masked auto-encoding objectives. Unsupervised analysis of HEIST representations of cells, shows that it effectively encodes the microenvironmental influences in cell embeddings, enabling the discovery of spatially-informed subpopulations that prior models fail to differentiate. Further, HEIST achieves state-of-the-art results on four downstream task such as clinical outcome prediction, cell type annotation, gene imputation, and spatially-informed cell clustering across multiple technologies, highlighting the importance of hierarchical modeling and GRN-based representations.},

	abstract = {The inherent similarities between natural language and biological sequences have given rise to great interest in adapting the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) underlying recent breakthroughs in natural language processing (references), for applications in genomics. However, current LLMs for genomics suffer from several limitations such as the inability to include chromatin interactions in the training data, and the inability to make prediction in new cellular contexts not represented in the training data. To mitigate these problems, we propose EpiGePT, a transformer-based pretrained language model for predicting context-specific epigenomic signals and chromatin contacts. By taking the context-specific activities of transcription factors (TFs) and 3D genome interactions into consideration, EpiGePT offers wider applicability and deeper biological insights than models trained on DNA sequence only. In a series of experiments, EpiGePT demonstrates superior performance in a diverse set of epigenomic signals prediction tasks when compared to existing methods. In particular, our model enables cross-cell-type prediction of long-range interactions and offers insight on the functional impact of genetic variants under different cellular contexts. These new capabilities will enhance the usefulness of LLM in the study of gene regulatory mechanisms. We provide free online prediction service of EpiGePT through http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/epigept/.},

Using burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have constructed a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, based on a generative pretrained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications.

TranscriptFormer jointly models genes and transcripts using a novel generative architecture, enabling it to function as a virtual instrument for probing cellular biology. In zero-shot settings, our models demonstrate superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cell type classification, with robust performance even for species separated by over 685 million years of evolutionary distance.

Recent DL models can predict the retention time, ion mobility and fragment intensities of a peptide just from the amino acid sequence with good accuracy. However, DL is a very rapidly developing field with new neural network architectures frequently appearing, which are challenging to incorporate for proteomics researchers. Here we introduce AlphaPeptDeep, a modular Python framework built on the PyTorch DL library that learns and predicts the properties of peptides (https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapeptdeep). It features a model shop that enables non-specialists to create models in just a few lines of code. AlphaPeptDeep represents post-translational modifications in a generic manner, even if only the chemical composition is known. Extensive use of transfer learning obviates the need for large data sets to refine models for particular experimental conditions. The AlphaPeptDeep models for predicting retention time, collisional cross sections and fragment intensities are at least on par with existing tools. Additional sequence-based properties can also be predicted by AlphaPeptDeep, as demonstrated with a HLA peptide prediction model to improve HLA peptide identification for data-independent acquisition (https://github.com/MannLabs/PeptDeep-HLA).},

Due to the complexity of the instrumentation and resulting data, sophisticated computational methods are required for the processing and interpretation of acquired mass spectra. Machine learning has shown great promise to improve the analysis of mass spectrometry data, with numerous purpose-built methods for improving specific steps in the data acquisition and analysis pipeline reaching widespread adoption. Here, we propose unifying various spectrum prediction tasks under a single foundation model for mass spectra. To this end, we pre-train a spectrum encoder using de novo sequencing as a pre-training task. We then show that using these pre-trained spectrum representations improves our performance on the four downstream tasks of spectrum quality prediction, chimericity prediction, phosphorylation prediction, and glycosylation status prediction. Finally, we perform multi-task fine-tuning and find that this approach improves the performance on each task individually. Overall, our work demonstrates that a foundation model for tandem mass spectrometry proteomics trained on de novo sequencing learns generalizable representations of spectra, improves performance on downstream tasks where training data is limited, and can ultimately enhance data acquisition and analysis in proteomics experiments.},

	abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a key technology in precision medicine, especially for cancer prognosis. However, the high dimensionality of such data may restrict classic statistical methods, thus raising the need to learn dense representations from them. Transformers models have exhibited capacities in providing representations for long sequences and thus are well suited for transcriptomics data. In this paper, we develop a pre-trained transformer-based language model through self-supervised learning using bulk RNA-seq from both non-cancer and cancer tissues, following BERT’s masking method. By probing learned embeddings from the model or using parameter-efficient fine-tuning, we then build downstream models for cancer-type classification and survival-time prediction. Leveraging the TCGA dataset, we demonstrate the performance of our method, BulkRNABert, on both tasks, with signifi-cant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods in the pan-cancer setting for classification and survival analysis. We also show the transfer-learning capabilities of the model in the survival analysis setting on unseen cohorts.
Data and Code Availability In this paper, we leverage the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), which includes bulk RNA-seq samples as well as clinical targets for each patient (cancer type, survival time). For pre-training experiments, this dataset is completed with non-cancerous bulk RNA-seq samples from GTEx (Carithers and Moore, 2015) and ENCODE (de Souza, 2012).

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundation models leading to breakthroughs in transcriptome analysis. However, current RNA-seq foundation models are exclusively pretrained on sparse single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, which typically detects only ∼3000 genes per cell. This thus creates a critical gap in models specifically designed for bulk transcriptomes, a fundamentally different modality capable of profiling ∼16,000 genes per sample. Here we propose BulkFormer, a large-scale foundation model for bulk transcriptome analysis. With 150 million parameters covering about 20,000 protein-coding genes, BulkFormer is pretrained on over 500,000 human bulk transcriptomic profiles. BulkFormer incorporates a hybrid encoder architecture, combining a graph neural network to capture explicit gene-gene interactions and a performer module to model global expression dependencies. As a result, despite incurring much lower training costs than scRNA-seq foundation models, BulkFormer consistently outperforms them in all six downstream tasks: transcriptome imputation, disease annotation, prognosis modeling, drug response prediction, compound perturbation simulation, and gene essentiality scoring. Notably, BulkFormer not only enhances the discovery of novel clinical biomarkers but also uncovers latent disease mechanisms by imputing biologically meaningful gene expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate BulkFormer’s power as a versatile and robust framework for bulk transcriptome modeling and biomedical discovery, bridging a critical gap in the current foundation model landscape.},

	abstract = {Cancer research encompasses data across various scales, modalities, and resolutions, from screening and diagnostic imaging to digitized histopathology slides to various types of molecular data and clinical records. The integration of these diverse data types for personalized cancer care and predictive modeling holds the promise of enhancing the accuracy and reliability of cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Traditional analytical methods, which often focus on isolated or unimodal information, fall short of capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of cancer data. The advent of deep neural networks has spurred the development of sophisticated multimodal data fusion techniques capable of extracting and synthesizing information from disparate sources. Among these, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal learning, demonstrating significant success. This review presents the foundational principles of multimodal learning including oncology data modalities, taxonomy of multimodal learning, and fusion strategies. We delve into the recent advancements in GNNs and Transformers for the fusion of multimodal data in oncology, spotlighting key studies and their pivotal findings. We discuss the unique challenges of multimodal learning, such as data heterogeneity and integration complexities, alongside the opportunities it presents for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of cancer. Finally, we present some of the latest comprehensive multimodal pan-cancer data sources. By surveying the landscape of multimodal data integration in oncology, our goal is to underline the transformative potential of multimodal GNNs and Transformers. Through technological advancements and the methodological innovations presented in this review, we aim to chart a course for future research in this promising field. This review may be the first that highlights the current state of multimodal modeling applications in cancer using GNNs and transformers, presents comprehensive multimodal oncology data sources, and sets the stage for multimodal evolution, encouraging further exploration and development in personalized cancer care.},

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are essential tools for estimating individual susceptibility to complex diseases by aggregating the effects of many genetic variants. With the advent of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), rare and de novo variants can now be detected at scale, presenting new opportunities to enhance PRS performance. Additionally, regulatory mechanisms that govern gene expression play a critical role in disease manifestation, suggesting further potential for improvement. However, most existing PRS methods are not well-equipped to incorporate nonlinear variant effects, rare variant contributions, or regulatory context. To address these limitations, we developed Epi-PRS, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to impute cell-type-specific epigenomic signals from personal diploid genotypes. These imputed signals act as informative intermediates between genotype and phenotype, allowing for more accurate modeling of variant impact. Our simulation studies demonstrate that Epi-PRS improves predictive accuracy by incorporating nonlinear relationships, rare variant effects, and regulatory information across large genomic regions. When applied to real data from the UK Biobank, Epi-PRS significantly outperforms existing PRS approaches in predicting risk for both breast cancer and type 2 diabetes. These results underscore the advantages of integrating WGS data, epigenomic context, and advanced LLMs framework to enhance both the predictive power and interpretability of PRS. Overall, Epi-PRS represents a promising step toward more precise and biologically informed disease risk prediction, with broad implications for advancing personalized medicine and understanding complex genetic architectures.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous noncoding variants associated with complex human diseases, disorders, and traits. However, resolving the uncertainty between GWAS association and causality remains a significant challenge. The small subset of noncoding GWAS variants with causative effects on gene regulatory elements can only be detected through accurate methods that assess the impact of DNA sequence variation on gene regulatory activity. Deep learning models, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have gained prominence in predicting the regulatory effects of genetic variants, particularly in enhancers, by learning patterns from genomic and epigenomic data. Despite their potential, selecting the most suitable model is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks, consistent training conditions, and performance evaluation criteria in existing reviews.
RESULTS: This study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity using nine datasets stemming from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments, profiling the regulatory impact of 54,859 SNPs across four human cell lines. The results reveal that CNN models, such as TREDNet and SEI, consistently outperform other architectures in predicting the regulatory impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, hybrid CNN-transformer models, such as Borzoi, display superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block. While fine-tuning enhances the performance of transformer-based models, it remains insufficient to surpass CNN and hybrid models when evaluated under optimized conditions.},

	abstract = {Understanding the molecular causes of complex diseases remains one of the most pressing challenges in biomedicine. Despite large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) mapping thousands of risk loci, identifying which genetic variants truly drive disease remains difficult. Traditional statistical genetics has laid a strong foundation for variant discovery, but it often struggles to capture non-linear interactions and cannot fully integrate the breadth of the interconnected multiomics data. In recent years, deep learning approaches have shown promise in bridging these gaps: modeling high-order genetic interactions, uncovering latent biological structure, and enabling multilayered data integration. However, issues like overfitting, lack of interpretability, and limited statistical rigor have slowed their adoption in causal inference and therapeutic target discovery. In this review, we explore how traditional statistical and deep learning methods can be applied to uncover causal mechanisms in complex disease. We critically examine the strengths and blind spots of traditional GWAS, post-GWAS fine-mapping, and Mendelian randomization, and contrast them with emerging deep learning frameworks for epistasis detection and multi-omics integration. Finally, we propose a future direction centered around hybrid models that blend the scalability of deep learning with the inferential power of statistical genetics. Our goal is to guide researchers in developing next-generation computational tools to uncover the molecular basis of complex diseases and accelerate the translation of genetic findings into effective treatments.},

	abstract = {Identifying causal genetic variants in a computational manner remains an open problem. Training end-to-end prediction models is not possible without large ground-truth datasets, while results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are entangled by linkage disequilibrium (LD), and gene expression datasets do not contain genetic variation at individual-level. Here, we propose Multiple Instance Fine-mapping (MIFM) – a multiple instance learning (MIL) objective to overcome the lack of strong labels by grouping putatively causal variants together based on their LD scores. Using MIFM, we trained a deep classifier on a dataset aggregating over 13, 000 GWAS to predict causal variants based on their underlying DNA sequences. We validated variants prioritized by MIFM by constructing polygenic risk scores which transferred better to different target ancestries. Furthermore, we demonstrated how MIFM can be used to disentangle effect sizes of highly-correlated variants to better fine-map GWAS results.
Author summary Genome-wide association studies have identified tens of thousands genetic variants associated with traits or diseases. However, the majority of identified variants is only spuriously correlated with the phenotype of interest, having no causal effect on it. Instead, these variants are often inherited together with nearby biologically causal variants, thus creating the spurious associations. Fine-mapping, i.e., predicting which variants are causal, is crucial for downstream tasks, such as uncovering the biological mechanisms affecting the phenotype or robustly identifying individuals with high genetic risk of a disease. While most fine-mapping methods are based on the available association statistics or functional annotations of genetic regions, it should be possible to identify causal variants based on their neighboring DNA sequences. However, training a standard machine learning classifier for that task is obstructed by the scarcity of strong, ground-truth labels. Here, we proposed a method to train sequence models predicting variant causality using weakly-labeled data. We trained a model on a large set of associated variants, and demonstrated its utility by improving cross-ancestry predictions of genetic risk, or disentangling the effect sizes of highly correlated variants.},

Antibodies are one of the few protein types where the volume of sequence data needed for such language models is available, e.g. in the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database.Here, we introduce AbLang, a language model trained on the antibody sequences in the OAS database. We demonstrate the power of AbLang by using it to restore missing residues in antibody sequence data, a key issue with B-cell receptor repertoire sequencing, e.g. over 40\% of OAS sequences are missing the first 15 amino acids. AbLang restores the missing residues of antibody sequences better than using IMGT germlines or the general protein language model ESM-1b. Further, AbLang does not require knowledge of the germline of the antibody and is seven times faster than ESM-1b.AbLang is a python package available at https://github.com/oxpig/AbLang.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online.},

	abstract = {Assessing the severity of new pathogenic variants requires an understanding of which mutations enable escape of the human immune response. Even single point mutations to an antigen can cause immune escape and infection by disrupting antibody binding. Recent work has modeled the effect of single point mutations on proteins by leveraging the information contained in large-scale, pretrained protein language models (PLMs). PLMs are often applied in a zero-shot setting, where the effect of each mutation is predicted based on the output of the language model with no additional training. However, this approach cannot appropriately model immune escape, which involves the interaction of two proteins—antibody and antigen—instead of one protein and requires making different predictions for the same antigenic mutation in response to different antibodies. Here, we explore several methods for predicting immune escape by building models on top of embeddings from PLMs. We evaluate our methods on a SARS-CoV-2 deep mutational scanning dataset and show that our embedding-based methods significantly outperform zero-shot methods, which have almost no predictive power. We also highlight insights gained into how best to use embeddings from PLMs to predict escape. Despite these promising results, simple statistical and machine learning baseline models that do not use pretraining perform comparably, showing that computationally expensive pretraining approaches may not be beneficial for escape prediction. Furthermore, all models perform relatively poorly, indicating that future work is necessary to improve escape prediction with or without pretrained embeddings.},

Previous studies reported several significant SNP–SNP interaction pairs that shared a common SNP to form a cluster, but some identified pairs might be false positives. This study aims to identify factors associated with the cluster effect of false positivity and develop strategies to enhance the accuracy of SNP–SNP interactions. The results showed the cluster effect is a major cause of false-positive findings of SNP–SNP interactions. This cluster effect is due to high correlations between a causal pair and null pairs in a cluster. The clusters with a hub SNP with a significant main effect and a large minor allele frequency (MAF) tended to have a higher false-positive rate. In addition, peripheral null SNPs in a cluster with a small MAF tended to enhance false positivity. We also demonstrated that using the modified significance criterion based on the 3 p-value rules and the bootstrap approach (3pRule + bootstrap) can reduce false positivity and maintain high true positivity. In addition, our results also showed that a pair without a significant main effect tends to have weak or no interaction. This study identified the cluster effect and suggested using the 3pRule + bootstrap approach to enhance SNP–SNP interaction detection accuracy.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised learning, particularly clustering, plays a pivotal role in disease subtyping and patient stratification, especially with the abundance of large-scale multi-omics data. Deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), can enhance clustering algorithms by leveraging inter-individual heterogeneity. However, the impact of confounders—external factors unrelated to the condition, e.g. batch effect or age—on clustering is often overlooked, introducing bias and spurious biological conclusions. In this work, we introduce four novel VAE-based deconfounding frameworks tailored for clustering multi-omics data. These frameworks effectively mitigate confounding effects while preserving genuine biological patterns. The deconfounding strategies employed include (i) removal of latent features correlated with confounders, (ii) a conditional VAE, (iii) adversarial training, and (iv) adding a regularization term to the loss function. Using real-life multi-omics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we simulated various confounding effects (linear, nonlinear, categorical, mixed) and assessed model performance across 50 repetitions based on reconstruction error, clustering stability, and deconfounding efficacy. Our results demonstrate that our novel models, particularly the conditional multi-omics VAE (cXVAE), successfully handle simulated confounding effects and recover biologically driven clustering structures. cXVAE accurately identifies patient labels and unveils meaningful pathological associations among cancer types, validating deconfounded representations. Furthermore, our study suggests that some of the proposed strategies, such as adversarial training, prove insufficient in confounder removal. In summary, our study contributes by proposing innovative frameworks for simultaneous multi-omics data integration, dimensionality reduction, and deconfounding in clustering. Benchmarking on open-access data offers guidance to end-users, facilitating meaningful patient stratification for optimized precision medicine.},

Most PRS methods assume that mutation effects scale linearly with the number of alleles and are constant across individuals.

We developed and provide Delphi (deep learning for phenotype inference), a deep-learning method that relaxes these assumptions to produce more predictive PRS. In contrast to other methods, Delphi can integrate up to hundreds of thousands of SNPs as input. We compare our results to a standard, linear PRS model, lasso regression, and a gradient-boosted trees-based method. We show that deep learning can be an effective approach to genetic risk prediction. We report a relative increase in the percentage variance explained compared to the state-of-the-art by 11.4\% for body mass index, 18.9\% for systolic blood pressure, 7.5\% for LDL, 35\% for C-reactive protein, 16.2\% for height, 29.6 \% for pulse rate; in addition, Delphi provides 2\% absolute explained variance for blood glucose while other tested methods were non-predictive. Furthermore, we show that Delphi tends to increase the weight of high-effect mutations.

	abstract = {Background
Deficiency in DNA-damage repair (DDR) genes, often due to disruptive coding variants, is linked to higher cancer risk. Our previous study has revealed the association between rare loss-of-function variants in DDR genes and the risk of lung cancer. However, it is still challenging to study the predisposing role of rare regulatory variants of these genes.

Methods
Based on whole-genome sequencing data from 2984 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 3020 controls, we performed massively parallel reporter assays on 1818 rare variants located in the promoters of DDR genes. Pathway- or gene-level burden analyses were performed using Firth’s logistic regression or generalized linear model.

Findings
We identified 750 rare functional regulatory variants (frVars) that showed allelic differences in transcriptional activity within the promoter regions of DDR genes. Interestingly, the burden of frVars was significantly elevated in cases (odds ratio [OR] = 1.17, p = 0.026), whereas the burden of variants prioritized solely based on bioinformatics annotation was comparable between cases and controls (OR = 1.04, p = 0.549). Among the frVars, 297 were down-regulated transcriptional activity (dr-frVars) and 453 were up-regulated transcriptional activity (ur-frVars); especially, dr-frVars (OR = 1.30, p = 0.008) rather than ur-frVars (OR = 1.06, p = 0.495) were significantly associated with risk of NSCLC. Individuals with NSCLC carried more dr-frVars from Fanconi anemia, homologous recombination, and nucleotide excision repair pathways. In addition, we identified seven genes (i.e., BRCA2, GTF2H1, DDB2, BLM, ALKBH2, APEX1, and RAD51B) with promoter dr-frVars that were associated with lung cancer susceptibility.

Interpretation
Our findings indicate that functional promoter variants in DDR genes, in addition to protein-truncating variants, can be pathogenic and contribute to lung cancer susceptibility.

A total of 1249 candidate variants were evaluated, and 30 potential causal variants within 12 loci were identified. Accordingly, we proposed three genetic architectures underlying NSCLC susceptibility: multiple causal variants in a single haplotype block (e.g. 4q22.1), multiple causal variants in multiple haplotype blocks (e.g. 5p15.33), and a single causal variant (e.g. 20q11.23). We developed a modified polygenic risk score using the potential causal variants from Chinese populations, improving the performance of risk prediction in 450,821 Europeans from the UK Biobank. Our findings not only augment the understanding of the genetic architecture underlying NSCLC susceptibility but also provide strategy to advance NSCLC risk stratification., Determining the causal variants at GWAS loci is crucial for understanding genetic disease mechanisms.

	abstract = {The classification of cancer subtypes is a crucial step towards more personalized treatment and has important implications for understanding the biological mechanisms of cancer subtypes. Multi-omics data present challenges in cancer research due to their high-dimensional feature spaces, significant noise, and limited sample sizes. However, the scale and heterogeneity of this data makes integration and classification a non-trivial task. Models based on correlations often contain confounding and redundant features, resulting in uninterpretability and weak generalization. Therefore, we proposed a novel multi-omics classification framework named Muti-omics Causal Graph Convolutional Network incorporated with causal structure learning and graph neural networks. Furthermore, the model can improve the performance and generalization capabilities of cancer classification by considering the prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions. This study constructed a more efficient framework for cancer subtype classification based on multi-omics data, which mainly include multi-omics data preprocessing, omics causal graph network construction, and multi-omics data integration methods. Finally, we demonstrated that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with fewer variables for higher accuracy on the real lung adenocarcinoma dataset from the cancer genome atlas program.},

	abstract = {Despite the emergence of experimental methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple omics modalities in single cells, most single-cell datasets include only one modality. A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces. Here, we propose a computational framework called GLUE (graph-linked unified embedding), which bridges the gap by modeling regulatory interactions across omics layers explicitly. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE.},

	abstract = {Most heritable diseases are polygenic. To comprehend the underlying genetic architecture, it is crucial to discover the clinically relevant epistatic interactions (EIs) between genomic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (1–3). Existing statistical computational methods for EI detection are mostly limited to pairs of SNPs due to the combinatorial explosion of higher-order EIs. With NeEDL (network-based epistasis detection via local search), we leverage network medicine to inform the selection of EIs that are an order of magnitude more statistically significant compared to existing tools and consist, on average, of five SNPs. We further show that this computationally demanding task can be substantially accelerated once quantum computing hardware becomes available. We apply NeEDL to eight different diseases and discover genes (affected by EIs of SNPs) that are partly known to affect the disease, additionally, these results are reproducible across independent cohorts. EIs for these eight diseases can be interactively explored in the Epistasis Disease Atlas (https://epistasis-disease-atlas.com). In summary, NeEDL demonstrates the potential of seamlessly integrated quantum computing techniques to accelerate biomedical research. Our network medicine approach detects higher-order EIs with unprecedented statistical and biological evidence, yielding unique insights into polygenic diseases and providing a basis for the development of improved risk scores and combination therapies.},

	abstract = {In light of the rapid accumulation of large-scale omics datasets, numerous studies have attempted to characterize the molecular and clinical features of cancers from a multi-omics perspective. However, there are great challenges in integrating multi-omics using machine learning methods for cancer subtype classification. In this study, MoGCN, a multi-omics integration model based on graph convolutional network (GCN) was developed for cancer subtype classification and analysis. Genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics datasets for 511 breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) samples were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The autoencoder (AE) and the similarity network fusion (SNF) methods were used to reduce dimensionality and construct the patient similarity network (PSN), respectively. Then the vector features and the PSN were input into the GCN for training and testing. Feature extraction and network visualization were used for further biological knowledge discovery and subtype classification. In the analysis of multi-dimensional omics data of the BRCA samples in TCGA, MoGCN achieved the highest accuracy in cancer subtype classification compared with several popular algorithms. Moreover, MoGCN can extract the most significant features of each omics layer and provide candidate functional molecules for further analysis of their biological effects. And network visualization showed that MoGCN could make clinically intuitive diagnosis. The generality of MoGCN was proven on the TCGA pan-kidney cancer datasets. MoGCN and datasets are public available at https://github.com/Lifoof/MoGCN. Our study shows that MoGCN performs well for heterogeneous data integration and the interpretability of classification results, which confers great potential for applications in biomarker identification and clinical diagnosis.},

Here we propose deep rare variant association testing (DeepRVAT), a model based on set neural networks that learns a trait-agnostic gene impairment score from rare variant annotations and phenotypes, enabling both gene discovery and trait prediction. On 34 quantitative and 63 binary traits, using whole-exome-sequencing data from UK Biobank, we find that DeepRVAT yields substantial gains in gene discoveries and improved detection of individuals at high genetic risk. Finally, we demonstrate how DeepRVAT enables calibrated and computationally efficient rare variant tests at biobank scale, aiding the discovery of genetic risk factors for human disease traits.},

Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences.

To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

To address this need, we introduce GENA language model (GENA-LM), a suite of transformer-based foundational DNA language models capable of handling input lengths up to 36 000 base pairs.

While language models have already achieved significant breakthroughs in protein biology, GENA-LM showcases a similarly promising potential for reshaping the landscape of genomics and multi-omics data analysis.

Additionally, the high computational cost of pretraining raises questions about its cost-efficiency. To assess the usefulness of pretraining in genomics, we evaluated seven different GFMs across various benchmarks, comparing them to their counterparts with randomly initialized weights. Surprisingly, we found that randomly initialized models can match or even surpass the performance of pretrained GFMs in finetuning and feature extraction tasks. We also discovered that pretrained GFMs fail to capture clinically relevant genetic mutations, which are crucial for understanding genetic disorders and phenotypic traits. Our results indicate that most of the current pretrained GFMs lack a ``foundational'' understanding of genomics and provide minimal utility, even for basic tasks such as sequence classification.

We use MambaDNA as the basis of Caduceus, the first family of RC equivariant bi-directional long-range DNA language models, and we introduce pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that yield Caduceus DNA foundation models.

Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context ({\textless}0.001\% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyena's new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level - an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 18 datasets using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data. On the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on 7 of 8 datasets on average by +10 accuracy points. Code at https://github.com/HazyResearch/hyena-dna.},

We established byte-pair encoding on the human genome and trained a foundation language model called GROVER (Genome Rules Obtained Via Extracted Representations) with the vocabulary selected via a custom task, next-k-mer prediction. The defined dictionary of tokens in the human genome carries best the information content for GROVER. Analysing learned representations, we observed that trained token embeddings primarily encode information related to frequency, sequence content and length. Some tokens are primarily localized in repeats, whereas the majority widely distribute over the genome. GROVER also learns context and lexical ambiguity. Average trained embeddings of genomic regions relate to functional genomics annotation and thus indicate learning of these structures purely from the contextual relationships of tokens. This highlights the extent of information content encoded by the sequence that can be grasped by GROVER. On fine-tuning tasks addressing genome biology with questions of genome element identification and protein–DNA binding, GROVER exceeds other models’ performance. GROVER learns sequence context, a sense for structure and language rules. Extracting this knowledge can be used to compose a grammar book for the code of life.},

We developed a deep learning–based framework, ExPecto, that can accurately predict, ab initio from a DNA sequence, the tissue-specific transcriptional effects of mutations, including those that are rare or that have not been observed. We prioritized causal variants within disease- or trait-associated loci from all publicly available genome-wide association studies and experimentally validated predictions for four immune-related diseases. By exploiting the scalability of ExPecto, we characterized the regulatory mutation space for human RNA polymerase II–transcribed genes by in silico saturation mutagenesis and profiled {\textgreater} 140 million promoter-proximal mutations. This enables probing of evolutionary constraints on gene expression and ab initio prediction of mutation disease effects, making ExPecto an end-to-end computational framework for the in silico prediction of expression and disease risk.},

We show that attention: (1) captures the folding structure of proteins, connecting amino acids that are far apart in the underlying sequence, but spatially close in the three-dimensional structure, (2) targets binding sites, a key functional component of proteins, and (3) focuses on progressively more complex biophysical properties with increasing layer depth. We find this behavior to be consistent across three Transformer architectures (BERT, ALBERT, XLNet) and two distinct protein datasets.

For decades, the predominant approach has been to infer evolutionary constraints from a set of related sequences. In the past year, protein language models have emerged as a potential alternative, but performance has fallen short of state-of-the-art approaches in bioinformatics. In this paper we demonstrate that Transformer attention maps learn contacts from the unsupervised language modeling objective.

These LMs reach for new prediction frontiers at low inference costs. Here, we trained two auto-regressive models (Transformer-XL, XLNet) and four auto-encoder models (BERT, Albert, Electra, T5) on data from UniRef and BFD containing up to 393 billion amino acids. The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer using 5616 GPUs and TPU Pod up-to 1024 cores. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the raw protein LM-embeddings from unlabeled data captured some biophysical features of protein sequences. We validated the advantage of using the embeddings as exclusive input for several subsequent tasks. The first was a per-residue prediction of protein secondary structure (3-state accuracy Q3=81\%-87\%); the second were per-protein predictions of protein sub-cellular localization (ten-state accuracy: Q10=81\%) and membrane vs. water-soluble (2-state accuracy Q2=91\%). For the per-residue predictions the transfer of the most informative embeddings (ProtT5) for the first time outperformed the state-of-the-art without using evolutionary information thereby bypassing expensive database searches. Taken together, the results implied that protein LMs learned some of the grammar of the language of life.

	abstract = {Cancer and its subtypes constitute approximately 30\% of all causes of death globally and display a wide range of heterogeneity in terms of clinical and molecular responses to therapy. Molecular subtyping has enabled the use of precision medicine to overcome these challenges and provide significant biological insights to predict prognosis and improve clinical decision-making. Over the past decade, conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been widely espoused for the classification of cancer subtypes from gene expression datasets. However, these methods are potentially biased toward the identification of cancer biomarkers. Hence, an end-to-end deep learning approach, DeepGene Transformer, is proposed which addresses the complexity of high-dimensional gene expression with a multi-head self-attention module by identifying relevant biomarkers across multiple cancer subtypes without requiring feature selection as a pre-requisite for the current classification algorithms. Comparative analysis reveals that the proposed DeepGene Transformer outperformed the commonly used traditional and state-of-the-art classification algorithms and can be considered an efficient approach for classifying cancer and its subtypes, indicating that any improvement in deep learning models in computational biologists can be reflected well in this domain as well.},

	abstract = {The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants stressed the demand for tools allowing to interpret the effect of single amino acid variants (SAVs) on protein function. While Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) sets continue to expand our understanding of the mutational landscape of single proteins, the results continue to challenge analyses. Protein Language Models (pLMs) use the latest deep learning (DL) algorithms to leverage growing databases of protein sequences. These methods learn to predict missing or masked amino acids from the context of entire sequence regions. Here, we used pLM representations (embeddings) to predict sequence conservation and SAV effects without multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Embeddings alone predicted residue conservation almost as accurately from single sequences as ConSeq using MSAs (two-state Matthews Correlation Coefficient-MCC-for ProtT5 embeddings of 0.596 ± 0.006 vs. 0.608 ± 0.006 for ConSeq). Inputting the conservation prediction along with BLOSUM62 substitution scores and pLM mask reconstruction probabilities into a simplistic logistic regression (LR) ensemble for Variant Effect Score Prediction without Alignments (VESPA) predicted SAV effect magnitude without any optimization on DMS data. Comparing predictions for a standard set of 39 DMS experiments to other methods (incl. ESM-1v, DeepSequence, and GEMME) revealed our approach as competitive with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using MSA input. No method outperformed all others, neither consistently nor statistically significantly, independently of the performance measure applied (Spearman and Pearson correlation). Finally, we investigated binary effect predictions on DMS experiments for four human proteins. Overall, embedding-based methods have become competitive with methods relying on MSAs for SAV effect prediction at a fraction of the costs in computing/energy. Our method predicted SAV effects for the entire human proteome ({\textasciitilde} 20 k proteins) within 40 min on one Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The sparse effector "omnigenic" hypothesis postulates that the polygenic effects of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a typical complex trait are mediated by trans effects that coalesce on expression of a relatively sparse set of core genes. The objective of this study was to identify core genes for rheumatoid arthritis by testing for association of rheumatoid arthritis with genome-wide aggregated trans effects (GATE) scores for expression of each gene as transcript in whole blood or as circulating protein levels.
METHODS: GATE scores were calculated for 5,400 cases and 453,705 non-cases of primary rheumatoid arthritis in UK Biobank participants of European ancestry.
RESULTS: Testing for association with GATE scores identified 16 putative core genes for rheumatoid arthritis outside the HLA region, of which six-TP53BP1, PDCD1, TNFRSF14, LAIR1, LILRA4, and IDO1-were supported by Mendelian randomization analysis based on the marginal likelihood of the causal effect parameter. Five of these 16 genes were validated by a reported association of rheumatoid arthritis with SNPs within 200 kb of the transcription site, eight by association of the measured protein level with rheumatoid arthritis in UK Biobank, 10 by experimental perturbation in mouse models of inflammatory arthritis, and two-CTLA4 and PDCD1-by evidence that drugs targeting the gene cause or ameliorate inflammatory arthritis in humans. Fourteen of these 16 genes are in pathways affecting immunity or inflammation, and six-CD5, CTLA4, TIGIT, LAIR1, TNFRSF14, and PDCD1-encode receptors that have been characterized as immune checkpoints exploited by cancer cells to escape the immune response.
CONCLUSION: These results highlight the key role of immune checkpoints in rheumatoid arthritis and identify possible therapeutic targets.},

Networks offer a natural abstraction by representing molecules as vertices and their interactions as edges, providing a foundation for constructing context-specific models tailored to particular conditions—an essential step in many biological analyses. Most existing approaches fall into one of two categories: machine learning methods, which offer strong predictive power but lack interpretability and require large datasets, and knowledge-based methods, which are more interpretable but designed for analysing individual samples and difficult to generalize. Here we present CORNETO, a unified mathematical framework that generalizes a wide variety of methods that learn biological networks from omics data and prior knowledge. CORNETO reformulates these methods as mixed-integer optimization problems using network flows and structured sparsity, enabling joint inference across multiple samples. This improves the discovery of both shared and sample-specific molecular mechanisms while yielding sparser, more interpretable solutions. CORNETO supports a range of prior knowledge structures, including undirected, directed and signed (hyper)graphs. It extends a broad class of approaches, ranging from Steiner trees to flux balance analysis, within a unified optimization-based interface. We demonstrate CORNETO’s utility across diverse biological contexts, including signalling, metabolism and integration with biologically informed deep learning. We provide CORNETO as an open-source Python library for flexible network modelling.},

	abstract = {Fitness landscapes,, depictions of how genotypes manifest at the phenotypic level, form the basis for our understanding of many areas of biology– yet their properties remain elusive. Studies addressing this issue often consider specific genes and their function as proxy for fitness,, experimentally assessing the impact on function of single mutations and their combinations in a specific sequence,,– or in different sequences,,,–. However, systematic high-throughput studies of the local fitness landscape of an entire protein have not yet been reported. Here, we chart an extensive region of the local fitness landscape of the green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria (avGFP) by measuring the native function, fluorescence, of tens of thousands of derivative genotypes of avGFP. We find that its fitness landscape is narrow, with half of genotypes with two mutations showing reduced fluorescence and half of genotypes with five mutations being completely non-fluorescent. The narrowness is enhanced by epistasis, which was detected in up to 30\% of genotypes with multiple mutations arising mostly through the cumulative impact of slightly deleterious mutations causing a threshold-like decrease of protein stability and concomitant loss of fluorescence. A model of orthologous sequence divergence spanning hundreds of millions of years predicted the extent of epistasis in our data, indicating congruence between the fitness landscape properties at the local and global scales. The characterization of the local fitness landscape of avGFP has important implications for a number of fields including molecular evolution, population genetics and protein design.},

	abstract = {Generative protein language models are a natural way to design new proteins with desired functions. However, current models are either difficult to direct to produce a protein from a specific family of interest, or must be trained on a large multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from the specific family of interest, making them unable to benefit from transfer learning across families. To address this, we propose \${\textbackslash}textbf\{P\}\$r\${\textbackslash}textbf\{o\}\$tein \${\textbackslash}textbf\{E\}\$volutionary \${\textbackslash}textbf\{T\}\$ransformer (PoET), an autoregressive generative model of whole protein families that learns to generate sets of related proteins as sequences-of-sequences across tens of millions of natural protein sequence clusters. PoET can be used as a retrieval-augmented language model to generate and score arbitrary modifications conditioned on any protein family of interest, and can extrapolate from short context lengths to generalize well even for small families. This is enabled by a unique Transformer layer; we model tokens sequentially within sequences while attending between sequences order invariantly, allowing PoET to scale to context lengths beyond those used during training. In extensive experiments on deep mutational scanning datasets, we show that PoET outperforms existing protein language models and evolutionary sequence models for variant function prediction across proteins of all MSA depths. We also demonstrate PoET's ability to controllably generate new protein sequences.},

From readily available sequence data alone, these models discover evolutionary, structural, and functional organization across protein space. Using language models, we can encode amino-acid sequences into distributed vector representations that capture their structural and functional properties, as well as evaluate the evolutionary fitness of sequence variants. We discuss recent advances in protein language modeling and their applications to downstream protein property prediction problems. We then consider how these models can be enriched with prior biological knowledge and introduce an approach for encoding protein structural knowledge into the learned representations. The knowledge distilled by these models allows us to improve downstream function prediction through transfer learning. Deep protein language models are revolutionizing protein biology. They suggest new ways to approach protein and therapeutic design. However, further developments are needed to encode strong biological priors into protein language models and to increase their accessibility to the broader community.},

	abstract = {The advent of modern genotyping technologies has revolutionized genomic selection in animal breeding. Large marker datasets have shown several drawbacks for traditional genomic prediction methods in terms of flexibility, accuracy, and computational power. Recently, the application of machine learning models in animal breeding has gained a lot of interest due to their tremendous flexibility and their ability to capture patterns in large noisy datasets. Here, we present a general overview of a handful of machine learning algorithms and their application in genomic prediction to provide a meta-picture of their performance in genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) estimation, genotype imputation, and feature selection. Finally, we discuss a potential adoption of ML models in genomic prediction in developing countries. The results of the reviewed studies showed that machine learning models have indeed performed well in fitting large noisy data sets and modeling minor nonadditive effects in some of the studies. However, sometimes conventional 1 methods outperformed machine learning models, which confirms that there's no universal method for genomic prediction. In summary, machine learning models have great potential for extracting patterns from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. Nonetheless, the level of their adoption in animal breeding is still low due to data limitations, complex genetic interactions, a lack of standardization and reproducibility, and the lack of interpretability of machine learning models when trained with biological data. Consequently, there is no remarkable outperformance of machine learning methods compared to traditional methods in genomic prediction. Therefore, more research should be conducted to discover new insights that could enhance livestock breeding programs.},

	abstract = {IntroductionEnhancer–promoter interactions (EPIs) play a vital role in the regulation of gene expression. Although traditional wet-lab methods provide valuable insights into EPIs, they are often constrained by high costs and limited scalability. As a result, the development of efficient computational models has become essential. However, many current deep learning and machine learning approaches utilize simplistic feature fusion strategies, such as direct averaging or concatenation, which fail to effectively model complex relationships and dynamic importance across features. This often results in suboptimal performance in challenging biological contexts.MethodsTo address these limitations, we propose a deep learning model named EPI-DynFusion. This model begins by encoding DNA sequences using pre-trained DNA embeddings and extracting local features through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then integrates a Transformer and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) architecture with a Dynamic Feature Fusion mechanism to adaptively learn deep dependencies among features. Furthermore, we incorporate the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance the model’s ability to focus on informative regions. Based on this core architecture, we develop two variants: EPI-DynFusion-gen, a general model, and EPI-DynFusion-best, a fine-tuned version for cell line–specific data.ResultsWe evaluated the performance of our models across six benchmark cell lines. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores achieved by the specific, generic, and best models were 94.8\%, 95.0\%, and 96.2\%, respectively. The average area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) scores were 81.2\%, 71.1\%, and 83.3\%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the fine-tuned model in the precision-recall space. These results confirm that the proposed fusion strategies and attention mechanisms contribute to significant improvements in performance.DiscussionIn conclusion, EPI-DynFusion presents a robust and scalable framework for predicting enhancer–promoter interactions solely based on DNA sequence information. By addressing the limitations of conventional fusion techniques and incorporating attention mechanisms alongside sequence modeling, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while enhancing the interpretability and generalizability of enhancer–promoter interaction prediction tasks.},

As an alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI) is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g., gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving over 20\% in PCC metrics.

By clustering tissue image patches based on both spatial and morphological features, and incorporating intra- and inter-cluster edges, our approach fosters interactions between distant tissue locations during GNN learning. As an additional contribution, we evaluate different data smoothing techniques that are necessary to mitigate artifacts in ST data, often caused by technical imperfections.

	abstract = {Background
In the evolving landscape of microbiology and microbiome analysis, the integration of machine learning is crucial for understanding complex microbial interactions, and predicting and recognizing novel functionalities within extensive datasets. However, the effectiveness of these methods in microbiology faces challenges due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of microbial data, further complicated by low signal-to-noise ratios, context-dependency, and a significant shortage of appropriately labeled datasets. This study introduces the ProkBERT model family, a collection of large language models, designed for genomic tasks. It provides a generalizable sequence representation for nucleotide sequences, learned from unlabeled genome data. This approach helps overcome the above-mentioned limitations in the field, thereby improving our understanding of microbial ecosystems and their impact on health and disease.

Methods
ProkBERT models are based on transfer learning and self-supervised methodologies, enabling them to use the abundant yet complex microbial data effectively. The introduction of the novel Local Context-Aware (LCA) tokenization technique marks a significant advancement, allowing ProkBERT to overcome the contextual limitations of traditional transformer models. This methodology not only retains rich local context but also demonstrates remarkable adaptability across various bioinformatics tasks.

Results
In practical applications such as promoter prediction and phage identification, the ProkBERT models show superior performance. For promoter prediction tasks, the top-performing model achieved a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.74 for E. coli and 0.62 in mixed-species contexts. In phage identification, ProkBERT models consistently outperformed established tools like VirSorter2 and DeepVirFinder, achieving an MCC of 0.85. These results underscore the models' exceptional accuracy and generalizability in both supervised and unsupervised tasks.

Conclusions
The ProkBERT model family is a compact yet powerful tool in the field of microbiology and bioinformatics. Its capacity for rapid, accurate analyses and its adaptability across a spectrum of tasks marks a significant advancement in machine learning applications in microbiology. The models are available on GitHub (https://github.com/nbrg-ppcu/prokbert) and HuggingFace (https://huggingface.co/nerualbioinfo) providing an accessible tool for the community.},

	abstract = {Deciphering the relationship between a gene and its genomic context is fundamental to understanding and engineering biological systems. Machine learning has shown promise in learning latent relationships underlying the sequence-structure-function paradigm from massive protein sequence datasets. However, to date, limited attempts have been made in extending this continuum to include higher order genomic context information. Evolutionary processes dictate the specificity of genomic contexts in which a gene is found across phylogenetic distances, and these emergent genomic patterns can be leveraged to uncover functional relationships between gene products. Here, we train a genomic language model (gLM) on millions of metagenomic scaffolds to learn the latent functional and regulatory relationships between genes. gLM learns contextualized protein embeddings that capture the genomic context as well as the protein sequence itself, and encode biologically meaningful and functionally relevant information (e.g. enzymatic function, taxonomy). Our analysis of the attention patterns demonstrates that gLM is learning co-regulated functional modules (i.e. operons). Our findings illustrate that gLM’s unsupervised deep learning of the metagenomic corpus is an effective and promising approach to encode functional semantics and regulatory syntax of genes in their genomic contexts and uncover complex relationships between genes in a genomic region.},

Differentiating species from genomic sequences (i.e., DNA and RNA) is vital yet challenging, since many real-world species remain uncharacterized, lacking known genomes for reference. Embedding-based methods are therefore used to differentiate species in an unsupervised manner. DNABERT-S builds upon a pre-trained genome foundation model named DNABERT-2. To encourage effective embeddings to error-prone long-read DNA sequences, we introduce Manifold Instance Mixup (MI-Mix), a contrastive objective that mixes the hidden representations of DNA sequences at randomly selected layers and trains the model to recognize and differentiate these mixed proportions at the output layer. We further enhance it with the proposed Curriculum Contrastive Learning (C\${\textasciicircum}2\$LR) strategy. Empirical results on 23 diverse datasets show DNABERT-S's effectiveness, especially in realistic label-scarce scenarios. For example, it identifies twice more species from a mixture of unlabeled genomic sequences, doubles the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) in species clustering, and outperforms the top baseline's performance in 10-shot species classification with just a 2-shot training.

	abstract = {Language models are thriving, powering conversational agents that assist and empower humans to solve a number of tasks. Recently, these models were extended to support additional modalities including vision, audio and video, demonstrating impressive capabilities across multiple domains, including healthcare. Still, conversational agents remain limited in biology as they cannot yet fully comprehend biological sequences. Meanwhile, high-performance foundation models for biological sequences have been built through self-supervision over sequencing data, but these need to be fine-tuned for each specific application, preventing generalization between tasks. In addition, these models are not conversational, which limits their utility to users with coding capabilities. Here we propose to bridge the gap between biology foundation models and conversational agents by introducing ChatNT, a multimodal conversational agent with an advanced understanding of biological sequences. ChatNT achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Nucleotide Transformer benchmark while being able to solve all tasks at once, in English, and to generalize to unseen questions. In addition, we have curated a set of more biologically relevant instruction tasks from DNA, RNA and proteins, spanning multiple species, tissues and biological processes. ChatNT reaches performance on par with state-of-the-art specialized methods on those tasks. We also present a perplexity-based technique to help calibrate the confidence of our model predictions. By applying attribution methods through the English decoder and DNA encoder, we demonstrate that ChatNT’s answers are based on biologically coherent features such as detecting the promoter TATA motif or splice site dinucleotides. Our framework for genomics instruction tuning can be extended to more tasks and data modalities (for example, structure and imaging), making it a widely applicable tool for biology. ChatNT provides a potential direction for building generally capable agents that understand biology from first principles while being accessible to users with no coding background.},

	abstract = {Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in several fields such as natural language processing, computer vision and more recently biology. DNA foundation models in particular are emerging as a promising approach for genomics. However, so far no model has delivered granular, nucleotide-level predictions across a wide range of genomic and regulatory elements, limiting its practical usefulness. In this paper, we build on our previous work on the Nucleotide Transformer (NT) to develop a segmentation model, SegmentNT, that processes input DNA sequences up to 30kb length to predict 14 different classes of genomics elements at single nucleotide resolution. By utilizing pre-trained weights from NT, SegmentNT surpasses the performance of several ablation models, including convolution networks with one-hot encoded nucleotide sequences and models trained from scratch. SegmentNT can process multiple sequence lengths with zero-shot generalization for sequences of up to 50kb. We show improved performance on the detection of splice sites throughout the genome and demonstrate strong nucleotide-level precision. Because it evaluates all gene elements simultaneously, SegmentNT can predict the impact of sequence variants not only on splice site changes but also on exon and intron rearrangements in transcript isoforms. Finally, we show that a SegmentNT model trained on human genomics elements can generalize to elements of different species and that a trained multispecies SegmentNT model achieves stronger generalization for all genic elements on unseen species. In summary, SegmentNT demonstrates that DNA foundation models can tackle complex, granular tasks in genomics at a single-nucleotide resolution. SegmentNT can be easily extended to additional genomics elements and species, thus representing a new paradigm on how we analyze and interpret DNA. We make our SegmentNT-30kb human and multispecies models available on our github repository in Jax and HuggingFace space in Pytorch.},

We introduce the concept of a unified representational space and employ a shared, multi-molecule vocabulary to effectively represent biological sequences and narrow their distance in the embedding space. Through extensive pretraining on comprehensive full molecular level data, CD-GPT exhibits exceptional performance in a wide range of predictive and generative downstream tasks, encompassing mono-molecular and multi-molecular analyses. Notably, CD-GPT excels in tasks such as genomic element detection, protein property prediction, RNA-protein interaction identification and also generative tasks like de novo protein generation and reverse translation.

We introduce VespaG, a blazingly fast missense amino acid variant effect predictor, leveraging protein language model (pLM) embeddings as input to a minimal deep learning model.To overcome the sparsity of experimental training data, we created a dataset of 39 million single amino acid variants from the human proteome applying the multiple sequence alignment-based effect predictor GEMME as a pseudo standard-of-truth. This setup increases interpretability compared to the baseline pLM and is easily retrainable with novel or updated pLMs. Assessed against the ProteinGym benchmark (217 multiplex assays of variant effect—MAVE—with 2.5 million variants), VespaG achieved a mean Spearman correlation of 0.48 ± 0.02, matching top-performing methods evaluated on the same data. VespaG has the advantage of being orders of magnitude faster, predicting all mutational landscapes of all proteins in proteomes such as Homo sapiens or Drosophila melanogaster in under 30 min on a consumer laptop (12-core CPU, 16 GB RAM).VespaG is available freely at https://github.com/jschlensok/vespag.

Unlike genomic models that focus on individual genomes or curated sets of specific species, the aim of METAGENE-1 is to capture the full distribution of genomic information present within this wastewater, to aid in tasks relevant to pandemic monitoring and pathogen detection. We carry out byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization on our dataset, tailored for metagenomic sequences, and then pretrain our model. In this paper, we first detail the pretraining dataset, tokenization strategy, and model architecture, highlighting the considerations and design choices that enable the effective modeling of metagenomic data. We then show results of pretraining this model on our metagenomic dataset, providing details about our losses, system metrics, and training stability over the course of pretraining. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of METAGENE-1, which achieves state-of-the-art results on a set of genomic benchmarks and new evaluations focused on human-pathogen detection and genomic sequence embedding, showcasing its potential for public health applications in pandemic monitoring, biosurveillance, and early detection of emerging health threats.},

	abstract = {The interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins are fundamental to biological processes, as illustrated by the central dogma of molecular biology. Although modern biological pre-trained models have achieved great success in analyzing these macromolecules individually, their interconnected nature remains underexplored. This paper follows the guidance of the central dogma to redesign both the data and model pipeline and offers a comprehensive framework, Life-Code, that spans different biological functions. As for data flow, we propose a unified pipeline to integrate multi-omics data by reverse-transcribing RNA and reverse-translating amino acids into nucleotide-based sequences. As for the model, we design a codon tokenizer and a hybrid long-sequence architecture to encode the interactions between coding and non-coding regions through masked modeling pre-training. To model the translation and folding process with coding sequences, Life-Code learns protein structures of the corresponding amino acids by knowledge distillation from off-the-shelf protein language models. Such designs enable Life-Code to capture complex interactions within genetic sequences, providing a more comprehensive understanding of multi-omics with the central dogma. Extensive experiments show that Life-Code achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks across three omics, highlighting its potential for advancing multi-omics analysis and interpretation.},

However, methods for measuring the organization of effector proteins at CREs across the genome are limited, hampering efforts to connect CRE structure to their function in cell fate and disease. Here we developed PRINT, a computational method that identifies footprints of DNA-protein interactions from bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility data across multiple scales of protein size. Using these multiscale footprints, we created the seq2PRINT framework, which uses deep learning to allow precise inference of transcription factor and nucleosome binding and interprets regulatory logic at CREs. Applying seq2PRINT to single-cell chromatin accessibility data from human bone marrow, we observe sequential establishment and widening of CREs centred on pioneer factors across haematopoiesis. We further discover age-associated alterations in the structure of CREs in murine haematopoietic stem cells, including widespread reduction of nucleosome footprints and gain of de novo identified Ets composite motifs. Collectively, we establish a method for obtaining rich insights into DNA-binding protein dynamics from chromatin accessibility data, and reveal the architecture of regulatory elements across differentiation and ageing.},

Analyses of such data can yield important insights, motivating the development of new statistical methods in this area.Single variant association analysis (including meta-analyses, conditional association and imputation) can be performed effectively using summary association data. These methods often rely on linkage disequilibrium (LD) information from population reference panels.Summary association data can be used to perform gene-based association tests to identify genes influencing complex traits. In particular, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) can be integrated to identify genes whose expression levels influence complex traits, and rare variant association tests can aggregate evidence of association across multiple rare variants in a gene.Statistical fine-mapping of causal variant (or variants) at GWAS loci can be performed using summary association data, leveraging information on the strength of association, functional genomic annotations and differences in LD patterns across different populations.It is becoming increasingly clear that most complex traits and common diseases have a large number of causal variants with small effects. Summary association statistics can be used to understand these polygenic architectures and leverage them for polygenic risk prediction.Summary association statistics have broad utility in cross-trait analyses, including detecting pleiotropic effects and inferring genetic correlations between traits. Pleiotropic effects can be used in Mendelian randomization analyses to draw inferences about causal relationships among traits.},

We find that ∼90\% of causal variants are non-coding, with ∼60\% mapping to immune-cell enhancers, many of which gain histone acetylation and transcribe enhancer-associated RNA upon immune stimulation. Causal variants tend to occur near binding sites for master regulators of immune differentiation and stimulus-dependent gene activation, but only 10–20\% directly alter recognizable transcription factor binding motifs.

Previously, we described a probabilistic framework that quantified the strengths of evidence (supporting, moderate, strong, very strong) within ACMG/AMP recommendations. We have extended this framework to computational predictors and introduce a new standard that converts a tool's scores to PP3 and BP4 evidence strengths. Our approach is based on estimating the local positive predictive value and can calibrate any computational tool or other continuous-scale evidence on any variant type. We estimate thresholds (score intervals) corresponding to each strength of evidence for pathogenicity and benignity for thirteen missense variant interpretation tools, using carefully assembled independent data sets. Most tools achieved supporting evidence level for both pathogenic and benign classification using newly established thresholds. Multiple tools reached score thresholds justifying moderate and several reached strong evidence levels. One tool reached very strong evidence level for benign classification on some variants. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for evidence-based revisions of the PP3 and BP4 ACMG/AMP criteria using individual tools and future assessment of computational methods for clinical interpretation.},

	abstract = {Knowing protein function is crucial to advance molecular and medical biology, yet experimental function annotations through the Gene Ontology (GO) exist for fewer than 0.5\% of all known proteins. Computational methods bridge this sequence-annotation gap typically through homology-based annotation transfer by identifying sequence-similar proteins with known function or through prediction methods using evolutionary information. Here, we propose predicting GO terms through annotation transfer based on proximity of proteins in the SeqVec embedding rather than in sequence space. These embeddings originate from deep learned language models (LMs) for protein sequences (SeqVec) transferring the knowledge gained from predicting the next amino acid in 33 million protein sequences. Replicating the conditions of CAFA3, our method reaches an Fmax of 37 ± 2\%, 50 ± 3\%, and 57 ± 2\% for BPO, MFO, and CCO, respectively. Numerically, this appears close to the top ten CAFA3 methods. When restricting the annotation transfer to proteins with {\textless} 20\% pairwise sequence identity to the query, performance drops (Fmax BPO 33 ± 2\%, MFO 43 ± 3\%, CCO 53 ± 2\%); this still outperforms naïve sequence-based transfer. Preliminary results from CAFA4 appear to confirm these findings. Overall, this new concept is likely to change the annotation of proteins, in particular for proteins from smaller families or proteins with intrinsically disordered regions.},

Despite decades of experimental progress many binding sites remain obscure. Here, we proposed bindEmbed21, a method predicting whether a protein residue binds to metal ions, nucleic acids, or small molecules. The Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based method exclusively uses embeddings from the Transformer-based protein Language Model (pLM) ProtT5 as input. Using only single sequences without creating multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), bindEmbed21DL outperformed MSA-based predictions. Combination with homology-based inference increased performance to F1 = 48 ± 3\% (95\% CI) and MCC = 0.46 ± 0.04 when merging all three ligand classes into one. All results were confirmed by three independent data sets. Focusing on very reliably predicted residues could complement experimental evidence: For the 25\% most strongly predicted binding residues, at least 73\% were correctly predicted even when ignoring the problem of missing experimental annotations. The new method bindEmbed21 is fast, simple, and broadly applicable—neither using structure nor MSAs. Thereby, it found binding residues in over 42\% of all human proteins not otherwise implied in binding and predicted about 6\% of all residues as binding to metal ions, nucleic acids, or small molecules.},

This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity.

Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.The source code, pretrained and finetuned model for DNABERT are available at GitHub (https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT).Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Large pretrained protein language models have improved protein sequence-tofunction prediction. This often takes the form of transfer learning, where final-layer representations from large pretrained models are extracted for downstream tasks. Although pretrained models have been empirically successful, there is little current understanding of how the features learned by pretraining relate to and are useful for downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate whether transferring a partial model, by using the output from a middle layer, is as effective as full model transfer, and if so, whether successful transfer depends on the downstream task and model properties. Across datasets and tasks, we evaluate partial model transfer of pretrained transformer and convolutional neural networks of varying sizes. We observe that pretrained representations outperform the one-hot baseline for most tasks. More importantly, we find that representations from middle layers can be as effective as those from later layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to report the effectiveness of partial model transfer for protein property prediction. Our results point to a mismatch between the pretraining and downstream tasks, indicating a need for more relevant pretraining tasks so that representations from later layers can be better utilized for downstream tasks.},

However, this experimental protocol is laborious and expensive. Moreover, experimental methods often produce noisy results. In this paper, we introduce a computational approach to the qualitative prediction of nucleosome occupancy, acetylation, and methylation areas in DNA sequences. Our method uses support vector machines to discriminate between DNA areas with high and low relative occupancy, acetylation, or methylation, and rank k-gram features based on their support for these DNA modifications. Experimental results on the yeast genome reveal genetic area preferences of nucleosome occupancy, acetylation, and methylation that are consistent with previous studies.

	abstract = {Enhancers are non-coding DAN fragments that play key roles in gene regulations and can promote the transcription of structural genes, thereby affecting the expression of structural protein catalytic enzymes and regulatory proteins. Accurate identification of enhancers helps to understand the transcription of structural genes and the development of human tumorigenesis, diagnosis and treatment. The enhancer sequences have high position variations and dispersions, and the identification of enhancers is more challenging than other genetic factors. Based on word embedding and sequence generative adversarial networks, a deep learning framework for enhancer identification is proposed. Firstly, considering the small number of sequences in the benchmark dataset, RankGAN is used to amplify the dataset size while maintaining the data characteristics. Then, in view of the similarity between DNA sequence and natural language, DNA sequence is regarded as a sentence composed of multiple "words", and the word embedding technology FastText is applied to transform it into a numerical matrix. To extract the dependencies and highly abstract features of nucleotides in DNA sequences, a Long Short-Term Memory Convolutional Neural network (LSTM-CNN) is constructed to perform the identification task. On the independent test set, the accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction are 0.7525 and 0.5051, respectively. For the enhancer type prediction, the accuracy and MCC of this method are 0.6972 and 0.3954, respectively. Compared with existing methods, this method achieves more satisfactory results for the prediction of enhancers and their types. This study will further enrich the application of natural language processing in bioinformatics.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12859-019-3306-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying splice sites is a necessary step to analyze the location and structure of genes. Two dinucleotides, GT and AG, are highly frequent on splice sites, and many other patterns are also on splice sites with important biological functions. Meanwhile, the dinucleotides occur frequently at the sequences without splice sites, which makes the prediction prone to generate false positives. Most existing tools select all the sequences with the two dimers and then focus on distinguishing the true splice sites from those pseudo ones. Such an approach will lead to a decrease in false positives; however, it will result in non-canonical splice sites missing.
RESULT: We have designed SpliceFinder based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict splice sites. To achieve the ab initio prediction, we used human genomic data to train our neural network. An iterative approach is adopted to reconstruct the dataset, which tackles the data unbalance problem and forces the model to learn more features of splice sites. The proposed CNN obtains the classification accuracy of 90.25\%, which is 10\% higher than the existing algorithms. The method outperforms other existing methods in terms of area under receiver operating characteristics (AUC), recall, precision, and F1 score. Furthermore, SpliceFinder can find the exact position of splice sites on long genomic sequences with a sliding window. Compared with other state-of-the-art splice site prediction tools, SpliceFinder generates results in about half lower false positive while keeping recall higher than 0.8. Also, SpliceFinder captures the non-canonical splice sites. In addition, SpliceFinder performs well on the genomic sequences of Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus, Rattus, and Danio rerio without retraining.
CONCLUSION: Based on CNN, we have proposed a new ab initio splice site prediction tool, SpliceFinder, which generates less false positives and can detect non-canonical splice sites. Additionally, SpliceFinder is transferable to other species without retraining. The source code and additional materials are available at https://gitlab.deepomics.org/wangruohan/SpliceFinder.},

DeePromoter combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM). Additionally, instead of using non-promoter regions of the genome as a negative set, we derive a more challenging negative set from the promoter sequences. The proposed negative set reconstruction method improves the discrimination ability and significantly reduces the number of false positive predictions. Consequently, DeePromoter outperforms the previously proposed promoter prediction tools.

In biomedicine and healthcare, they can represent, for example, molecular interactions, signalling pathways, disease co-morbidities or healthcare systems. In this Perspective, we posit that representation learning can realize principles of network medicine, discuss successes and current limitations of the use of representation learning on graphs in biomedicine and healthcare, and outline algorithmic strategies that leverage the topology of graphs to embed them into compact vectorial spaces. We argue that graph representation learning will keep pushing forward machine learning for biomedicine and healthcare applications, including the identification of genetic variants underlying complex traits, the disentanglement of single-cell behaviours and their effects on health, the assistance of patients in diagnosis and treatment, and the development of safe and effective medicines.},

Many methods for data integration have been developed for the identification of key elements that explain or predict disease risk or other biological outcomes. The heterogeneous graph representation of multi-omics data provides an advantage for discerning patterns suitable for predictive/exploratory analysis, thus permitting the modeling of complex relationships. Graph-based approaches—including graph neural networks—potentially offer a reliable methodological toolset that can provide a tangible alternative to scientists and clinicians that seek ideas and implementation strategies in the integrated analysis of their omics sets for biomedical research. Graph-based workflows continue to push the limits of the technological envelope, and this perspective provides a focused literature review of research articles in which graph machine learning is utilized for integrated multi-omics data analyses, with several examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based approaches.},

	abstract = {Genomic profiles of cancer cells provide valuable information on genetic alterations in cancer. Several recent studies employed these data to predict the response of cancer cell lines to drug treatment. Nonetheless, due to the multifactorial phenotypes and intricate mechanisms of cancer, the accurate prediction of the effect of pharmacotherapy on a specific cell line based on the genetic information alone is problematic. Emphasizing on the system-level complexity of cancer, we devised a procedure to integrate multiple heterogeneous data, including biological networks, genomics, inhibitor profiling, and gene-disease associations, into a unified graph structure. In order to construct compact, yet information-rich cancer-specific networks, we developed a novel graph reduction algorithm. Driven by not only the topological information, but also the biological knowledge, the graph reduction increases the feature-only entropy while preserving the valuable graph-feature information. Subsequent comparative benchmarking simulations employing a tissue level cross-validation protocol demonstrate that the accuracy of a graph-based predictor of the drug efficacy is 0.68, which is notably higher than those measured for more traditional, matrix-based techniques on the same data. Overall, the non-Euclidean representation of the cancer-specific data improves the performance of machine learning to predict the response of cancer to pharmacotherapy.

Cytosine methylation, in particular, functions as a critical epigenetic switchboard, dynamically programming cellular identity, adapting gene expression in response to environmental cues, and underpinning the onset and progression of numerous diseases. Here we present Pleiades, a series of whole-genome epigenetic foundation models spanning three sizes: 90M, 600M, and 7B parameters. Pleiades is trained upon an extensive proprietary dataset of methylated and unmethylated human DNA sequences totalling 1.9T tokens. We introduce alignment embeddings and stacked hierarchical attention techniques to provide precise epigenetic modelling without the need for extended context lengths. Collectively, these advances enable Pleiades to perform a diverse range of downstream biological and clinical tasks, including nucleotide-level regulatory prediction, realistic generation of cell-free DNA fragments and fragment-level celltype-of-origin classification, within a unified and scalable computational framework. We specifically apply Pleiades to the early detection of real-world cohorts of clinical Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, achieving high-accuracy. We integrate Pleiades with leading protein biomarkers, achieving state-of-the-art results, underscoring the complementary value of epigenomic and proteomic multi-modal approaches. By advancing beyond the modelling of pure DNA sequences and relying on limited genomic regions, Pleiades establishes genome-wide epigenomic modelling as a new paradigm for clinical diagnostics, synthetic biology, and precision medicine.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the pathogenicity of protein variants in human disease-related genes would have a marked effect on clinical decisions, yet the overwhelming majority (over 98\%) of these variants still have unknown consequences1–3. In principle, computational methods could support the large-scale interpretation of genetic variants. However, state-of-the-art methods4–10 have relied on training machine learning models on known disease labels. As these labels are sparse, biased and of variable quality, the resulting models have been considered insufficiently reliable11. Here we propose an approach that leverages deep generative models to predict variant pathogenicity without relying on labels. By modelling the distribution of sequence variation across organisms, we implicitly capture constraints on the protein sequences that maintain fitness. Our model EVE (evolutionary model of variant effect) not only outperforms computational approaches that rely on labelled data but also performs on par with, if not better than, predictions from high-throughput experiments, which are increasingly used as evidence for variant classification12–16. We predict the pathogenicity of more than 36 million variants across 3,219 disease genes and provide evidence for the classification of more than 256,000 variants of unknown significance. Our work suggests that models of evolutionary information can provide valuable independent evidence for variant interpretation that will be widely useful in research and clinical settings.},

It provides a one-stop-shop platform for researchers to create deep-learning models through an interactive web interface and train these models with uploaded data, using high-performance computing resources plugged at the backend. G2PDeep also provides a series of informative interfaces to monitor the training process and compare the performance among the trained models. The trained models can then be deployed automatically. The quantitative phenotype and genomic markers are predicted using a user-selected trained model and the results are visualized. Our state-of-the-art model has been benchmarked and demonstrated competitive performance in quantitative phenotype predictions by other researchers. In addition, the server integrates the soybean nested association mapping (SoyNAM) dataset with five phenotypes, including grain yield, height, moisture, oil, and protein. A publicly available dataset for seed protein and oil content has also been integrated into the server. The G2PDeep server is publicly available at http://g2pdeep.org.

Here we describe the graphical missense variant pathogenicity predictor (gMVP), a new method based on graph attention neural networks. Its main component is a graph with nodes that capture predictive features of amino acids and edges weighted by co-evolution strength, enabling effective pooling of information from the local protein context and functionally correlated distal positions. Evaluation of deep mutational scan data shows that gMVP outperforms other published methods in identifying damaging variants in TP53, PTEN, BRCA1 and MSH2. Furthermore, it achieves the best separation of de novo missense variants in neurodevelopmental disorder cases from those in controls. Finally, the model supports transfer learning to optimize gain- and loss-of-function predictions in sodium and calcium channels. In summary, we demonstrate that gMVP can improve interpretation of missense variants in clinical testing and genetic studies.},

Due to the wealth of these methods, an important practical question to answer is which of these tools generalize best, that is, correctly predict the pathogenic character of new variants. We here demonstrate in a study of 10 tools on five datasets that such a comparative evaluation of these tools is hindered by two types of circularity: they arise due to (1) the same variants or (2) different variants from the same protein occurring both in the datasets used for training and for evaluation of these tools, which may lead to overly optimistic results.

	abstract = {The ability to accurately model the fitness landscape of protein sequences is critical to a wide range of applications, from quantifying the effects of human variants on disease likelihood, to predicting immune-escape mutations in viruses and designing novel biotherapeutic proteins. Deep generative models of protein sequences trained on multiple sequence alignments have been the most successful approaches so far to address these tasks. The performance of these methods is however contingent on the availability of sufficiently deep and diverse alignments for reliable training. Their potential scope is thus limited by the fact many protein families are hard, if not impossible, to align. Large language models trained on massive quantities of non-aligned protein sequences from diverse families address these problems and show potential to eventually bridge the performance gap. We introduce Tranception, a novel transformer architecture leveraging autoregressive predictions and retrieval of homologous sequences at inference to achieve state-of-the-art fitness prediction performance. Given its markedly higher performance on multiple mutants, robustness to shallow alignments and ability to score indels, our approach offers significant gain of scope over existing approaches. To enable more rigorous model testing across a broader range of protein families, we develop ProteinGym -- an extensive set of multiplexed assays of variant effects, substantially increasing both the number and diversity of assays compared to existing benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Transformer models have shown strong performance on biological sequence prediction tasks, but the interpretability of their internal mechanisms remains underexplored. Given their application in biomedical research, understanding the mechanisms behind these models’ predictions is crucial for their widespread adoption. We introduce a method to interpret attention heads in genomic transformers by correlating per-token attention scores with curated biological annotations, and we use GPT-4 to summarize each head’s focus. Applying this to DNABERT, Nucleotide Transformer, and scGPT, we find that attention heads learn biologically meaningful associations during self-supervised pre-training and that these associations shift with fine-tuning. We show that interpretability varies with tokenization scheme, and that context-dependence plays a key role in head behaviour. Through ablation, we demonstrate that heads strongly associated with biological features are more important for task performance than uninformative heads in the same layers. In DNABERT trained for TATA promoter prediction, we observe heads with positive and negative associations reflecting positive and negative learning dynamics. Our results offer a framework to trace how biological features are learned from random initialization to pre-training to fine-tuning, enabling insight into how genomic foundation models represent nucleotides, genes, and cells.},

Cohesin and CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) are key regulators; perturbing the levels of either greatly disrupts genome-wide folding as assayed by chromosome conformation capture methods. Still, how a given DNA sequence encodes a particular locus-specific folding pattern remains unknown. Here we present a convolutional neural network, Akita, that accurately predicts genome folding from DNA sequence alone. Representations learned by Akita underscore the importance of an orientation-specific grammar for CTCF binding sites. Akita learns predictive nucleotide-level features of genome folding, revealing effects of nucleotides beyond the core CTCF motif. Once trained, Akita enables rapid in silico predictions. Accounting for this, we demonstrate how Akita can be used to perform in silico saturation mutagenesis, interpret eQTLs, make predictions for structural variants and probe species-specific genome folding. Collectively, these results enable decoding genome function from sequence through structure.},

	abstract = {Predictive models mapping double-stranded DNA to signals of regulatory activity should, in principle, produce analogous (or “equivariant”) predictions whether the forward strand or its reverse complement (RC) is supplied as input. Unfortunately, standard neural networks can produce highly divergent predictions across strands, even when the training set is augmented with RC sequences. Two strategies have emerged to enforce equivariance: conjoined/“siamese” architectures, and RC parameter sharing or RCPS. However, the connections between the two remain unclear, comparisons to strong baselines are lacking, and neither has been adapted to base-resolution signal profile prediction. In this work, we extend conjoined \& RCPS models to base-resolution signal prediction, and introduce a strong baseline: a standard model (trained with RC data augmentation) that is made conjoined only after training, which we call “post-hoc” conjoined. Through benchmarks on diverse tasks, we find post-hoc conjoined consistently performs best or second-best, surpassed only occasionally by RCPS, and never underperforms conjoined-during-training. We propose an overfitting-based hypothesis for the latter finding, and study it empirically. Despite its theoretical appeal, RCPS shows mediocre performance on several tasks, even though (as we prove) it can represent any solution learned by conjoined models. Our results suggest users interested in RC equivariance should default to post-hoc conjoined as a reliable baseline before exploring RCPS. Finally, we present a unified description of conjoined \& RCPS architectures, revealing a broader class of models that gradually interpolate between RCPS and conjoined while maintaining equivariance.

Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30 million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.},

In centrality methods, researchers are required to design a score function which is based on prior knowledge, yet is usually not sufficient to capture the complexity of biological information. In machine learning-based methods, some selected biological features cannot represent the complete properties of biological information as they lack a computational framework to automatically select features. To tackle these problems, we propose a deep learning framework to automatically learn biological features without prior knowledge. We use node2vec technique to automatically learn a richer representation of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network topologies than a score function. Bidirectional long short term memory cells are applied to capture non-local relationships in gene expression data. For subcellular localization information, we exploit a high dimensional indicator vector to characterize their feature. To evaluate the performance of our method, we tested it on PPI network of S. cerevisiae. Our experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method is better than traditional centrality methods and is superior to existing machine learning-based methods. To explore which of the three types of biological information is the most vital element, we conduct an ablation study by removing each component in turn. Our results show that the PPI network embedding contributes most to the improvement. In addition, gene expression profiles and subcellular localization information are also helpful to improve the performance in identification of essential proteins.},

Computational approaches helped to mitigate experimental constraints by exploring machine learning (ML) methods and the correlation of essentiality with biological information, especially protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, to predict essential genes. Nonetheless, their performance is still limited, as network-based centralities are not exclusive proxies of essentiality, and traditional ML methods are unable to learn from non-euclidean domains such as graphs. Given these limitations, we proposed EPGAT, an approach for Essentiality Prediction based on Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which are attention-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), operating on graph-structured data. Our model directly learns gene essentiality patterns from PPI networks, integrating additional evidence from multiomics data encoded as node attributes. We benchmarked EPGAT for four organisms, including humans, accurately predicting gene essentiality with ROC AUC score ranging from 0.78 to 0.97. Our model significantly outperformed network-based and shallow ML-based methods and achieved a very competitive performance against the state-of-the-art node2vec embedding method. Notably, EPGAT was the most robust approach in scenarios with limited and imbalanced training data. Thus, the proposed approach offers a powerful and effective way to identify essential genes and proteins.},

The hypergraph is then trained to generate suitably structured embeddings for discovering unknown interactions. Comprehensive experiments performed on four public datasets demonstrate that HHDTI achieves significant and consistently improved predictions compared with state-of-the-art methods.

While early results are promising, this is a rapidly evolving field with new knowledge emerging in both cancer biology and deep learning. In this review, we provide an overview of emerging deep learning techniques and how they are being applied to oncology. We focus on the deep learning applications for omics data types, including genomic, methylation and transcriptomic data, as well as histopathology-based genomic inference, and provide perspectives on how the different data types can be integrated to develop decision support tools. We provide specific examples of how deep learning may be applied in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment management. We also assess the current limitations and challenges for the application of deep learning in precision oncology, including the lack of phenotypically rich data and the need for more explainable deep learning models. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how current obstacles can be overcome to enable future clinical utilisation of deep learning.},

Multi-omics data integration strategies are needed to combine the complementary knowledge brought by each omics layer.

	abstract = {Historically, gene expression has been shown to be the most informative data for drug response prediction. Recent evidence suggests that integrating additional omics can improve the prediction accuracy which raises the question of how to integrate the additional omics. Regardless of the integration strategy, clinical utility and translatability are crucial. Thus, we reasoned a multi-omics approach combined with clinical datasets would improve drug response prediction and clinical relevance.We propose MOLI, a multi-omics late integration method based on deep neural networks. MOLI takes somatic mutation, copy number aberration and gene expression data as input, and integrates them for drug response prediction. MOLI uses type-specific encoding sub-networks to learn features for each omics type, concatenates them into one representation and optimizes this representation via a combined cost function consisting of a triplet loss and a binary cross-entropy loss. The former makes the representations of responder samples more similar to each other and different from the non-responders, and the latter makes this representation predictive of the response values. We validate MOLI on in vitro and in vivo datasets for five chemotherapy agents and two targeted therapeutics. Compared to state-of-the-art single-omics and early integration multi-omics methods, MOLI achieves higher prediction accuracy in external validations. Moreover, a significant improvement in MOLI’s performance is observed for targeted drugs when training on a pan-drug input, i.e. using all the drugs with the same target compared to training only on drug-specific inputs. MOLI’s high predictive power suggests it may have utility in precision oncology.https://github.com/hosseinshn/MOLI.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Trained on these extracted features only, a supervised classifier, DeepC, can effectively distinguish tumors from normal samples with an accuracy of 90\% for Pan-Cancer and reach an average 94\% for specific cancers. Training on a connected network, the accuracy is further increased to 96\% for Pan-Cancer. Together, our study shows that deep learning with autoencoder is suitable for transcriptomic analysis, and DeepT2Vec could be successfully applied to distinguish cancers, normal tissues, and other potential traits with limited samples.},

Due to the vast amount of gene expression data, this task becomes complex and time consuming. This paper provides a recent review on recent progress in ML and deep learning (DL) for cancer classification, which has received increasing attention in bioinformatics and computational biology. The development of cancer classification methods based on ML and DL is mostly focused on this review. Although many methods have been applied to the cancer classification problem, recent progress shows that most of the successful techniques are those based on supervised and DL methods. In addition, the sources of the healthcare dataset are also described. The development of many machine learning methods for insight analysis in cancer classification has brought a lot of improvement in healthcare. Currently, it seems that there is highly demanded further development of efficient classification methods to address the expansion of healthcare applications.},

Nevertheless, it is challenging to capture them from the genome-wide data, due to the large number of molecular features and small number of available samples, which is also called “the curse of dimensionality” in machine learning. To tackle this problem and pave the way for machine learning-aided precision medicine, we proposed a unified multi-task deep learning framework named OmiEmbed to capture biomedical information from high-dimensional omics data with the deep embedding and downstream task modules. The deep embedding module learnt an omics embedding that mapped multiple omics data types into a latent space with lower dimensionality. Based on the new representation of multi-omics data, different downstream task modules were trained simultaneously and efficiently with the multi-task strategy to predict the comprehensive phenotype profile of each sample. OmiEmbed supports multiple tasks for omics data including dimensionality reduction, tumour type classification, multi-omics integration, demographic and clinical feature reconstruction, and survival prediction. The framework outperformed other methods on all three types of downstream tasks and achieved better performance with the multi-task strategy compared to training them individually. OmiEmbed is a powerful and unified framework that can be widely adapted to various applications of high-dimensional omics data and has great potential to facilitate more accurate and personalised clinical decision making.},

Pretraining models are used for embedding biological sequence and extracting feature from large biological sequence corpus to comprehensively understand the biological sequence data. In this survey, we provide a broad review on pretraining models for biological sequence data. Moreover, we first introduce biological sequences and corresponding datasets, including brief description and accessible link. Subsequently, we systematically summarize popular pretraining models for biological sequences based on four categories: CNN, word2vec, LSTM and Transformer. Then, we present some applications with proposed pretraining models on downstream tasks to explain the role of pretraining models. Next, we provide a novel pretraining scheme for protein sequences and a multitask benchmark for protein pretraining models. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in pretraining models for biological sequences.},

	abstract = {Cancers are mainly caused by somatic genomic alterations (SGAs) that perturb cellular signaling systems and eventually activate oncogenic processes. Therefore, understanding the functional impact of SGAs is a fundamental task in cancer biology and precision oncology. Here, we present a deep neural network model with encoder-decoder architecture, referred to as genomic impact transformer (GIT), to infer the functional impact of SGAs on cellular signaling systems through modeling the statistical relationships between SGA events and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in tumors. The model utilizes a multi-head self-attention mechanism to identify SGAs that likely cause DEGs, or in other words, differentiating potential driver SGAs from passenger ones in a tumor. GIT model learns a vector (gene embedding) as an abstract representation of functional impact for each SGA-affected gene. Given SGAs of a tumor, the model can instantiate the states of the hidden layer, providing an abstract representation (tumor embedding) reflecting characteristics of perturbed molecular/cellular processes in the tumor, which in turn can be used to predict multiple phenotypes. We apply the GIT model to 4,468 tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The attention mechanism enables the model to better capture the statistical relationship between SGAs and DEGs than conventional methods, and distinguishes cancer drivers from passengers. The learned gene embeddings capture the functional similarity of SGAs perturbing common pathways. The tumor embeddings are shown to be useful for tumor status representation, and phenotype prediction including patient survival time and drug response of cancer cell lines.},

In this study, we evaluate the contributions of various input features, such as mutation profiles, mutation rates, mutation spectra and signatures, and somatic copy number alterations that can be derived from genomic data, and further utilize them for accurate cancer type classification. We introduce a novel ensemble of machine learning classifiers, called CPEM (Cancer Predictor using an Ensemble Model), which is tested on 7,002 samples representing over 31 different cancer types collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We first systematically examined the impact of the input features. Features known to be associated with specific cancers had relatively high importance in our initial prediction model. We further investigated various machine learning classifiers and feature selection methods to derive the ensemble-based cancer type prediction model achieving up to 84\% classification accuracy in the nested 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, we narrowed down the target cancers to the six most common types and achieved up to 94\% accuracy.},

This ‘black box’ problem can undermine the credibility and limit the practical implementation of biomedical deep learning models. Here we present XOmiVAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based interpretable deep learning model for cancer classification using high-dimensional omics data. XOmiVAE is capable of revealing the contribution of each gene and latent dimension for each classification prediction and the correlation between each gene and each latent dimension. It is also demonstrated that XOmiVAE can explain not only the supervised classification but also the unsupervised clustering results from the deep learning network. To the best of our knowledge, XOmiVAE is one of the first activation level-based interpretable deep learning models explaining novel clusters generated by VAE. The explainable results generated by XOmiVAE were validated by both the performance of downstream tasks and the biomedical knowledge. In our experiments, XOmiVAE explanations of deep learning-based cancer classification and clustering aligned with current domain knowledge including biological annotation and academic literature, which shows great potential for novel biomedical knowledge discovery from deep learning models.},

	abstract = {High-dimensional clinical data are becoming more accessible in biobank-scale datasets. However, effectively utilizing high-dimensional clinical data for genetic discovery remains challenging. Here we introduce a general deep learning-based framework, REpresentation learning for Genetic discovery on Low-dimensional Embeddings (REGLE), for discovering associations between genetic variants and high-dimensional clinical data. REGLE uses convolutional variational autoencoders to compute a non-linear, low-dimensional, disentangled embedding of the data with highly heritable individual components. REGLE can incorporate expert-defined or clinical features and provides a framework to create accurate disease-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS) in datasets which have minimal expert phenotyping. We apply REGLE to both respiratory and circulatory systems: spirograms which measure lung function and photoplethysmograms (PPG) which measure blood volume changes. Genome-wide association studies on REGLE embeddings identify more genome-wide significant loci than existing methods and replicate known loci for both spirograms and PPG, demonstrating the generality of the framework. Furthermore, these embeddings are associated with overall survival. Finally, we construct a set of PRSs that improve predictive performance of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and systolic blood pressure in multiple biobanks. Thus, REGLE embeddings can quantify clinically relevant features that are not currently captured in a standardized or automated way.},

Until recently, brain measures for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisted of traditionally expert-defined or software-derived image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that are often based on theoretical preconceptions or computed from limited amounts of data. Here, we present an approach to derive brain imaging phenotypes using unsupervised deep representation learning. We train a 3-D convolutional autoencoder model with reconstruction loss on 6,130 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants’ T1 or T2-FLAIR (T2) brain MRIs to create a 128-dimensional representation known as endophenotypes (ENDOs). GWAS of these ENDOs in held-out UKBB subjects (n = 22,962 discovery and n = 12,848/11,717 replication cohorts for T1/T2) identified 658 significant replicated variant-ENDO pairs involving 43 independent loci. Thirteen loci were not reported in earlier T1 and T2 IDP-based UK Biobank GWAS. We developed a perturbation-based decoder interpretation approach to show that these loci are associated with ENDOs mapped to multiple relevant brain regions. Our results established unsupervised deep learning can derive robust, unbiased, heritable, and interpretable endophenotypes from imaging data.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Emergence of genetic data coupled to longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) offers the possibility of phenome-wide association scans (PheWAS) for disease–gene associations. We propose a novel method to scan phenomic data for genetic associations using International Classification of Disease (ICD9) billing codes, which are available in most EMR systems. We have developed a code translation table to automatically define 776 different disease populations and their controls using prevalent ICD9 codes derived from EMR data. As a proof of concept of this algorithm, we genotyped the first 6005 European–Americans accrued into BioVU, Vanderbilt's DNA biobank, at five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with previously reported disease associations: atrial fibrillation, Crohn's disease, carotid artery stenosis, coronary artery disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The PheWAS software generated cases and control populations across all ICD9 code groups for each of these five SNPs, and disease-SNP associations were analyzed. The primary outcome of this study was replication of seven previously known SNP–disease associations for these SNPs.Results: Four of seven known SNP–disease associations using the PheWAS algorithm were replicated with P-values between 2.8 × 10−6 and 0.011. The PheWAS algorithm also identified 19 previously unknown statistical associations between these SNPs and diseases at P \&lt; 0.01. This study indicates that PheWAS analysis is a feasible method to investigate SNP–disease associations. Further evaluation is needed to determine the validity of these associations and the appropriate statistical thresholds for clinical significance.Availability:The PheWAS software and code translation table are freely available at http://knowledgemap.mc.vanderbilt.edu/research.Contact:  josh.denny@vanderbilt.edu},

Here we develop a temporal model for these unobserved molecular changes with a manifold learning method applied to RNA-Seq data collected from human postmortem brain samples collected within the ROS/MAP and Mayo Clinic RNA-Seq studies. We define an ordering across samples based on their similarity in gene expression and use this ordering to estimate the molecular disease stage–or disease pseudotime-for each sample. Disease pseudotime is strongly concordant with the burden of tau (Braak score, P = 1.0 × 10−5), Aβ (CERAD score, P = 1.8 × 10−5), and cognitive diagnosis (P = 3.5 × 10−7) of late-onset (LO) AD. Early stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for controls and show changes in basic cellular functions. Late stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for late stage AD cases and show changes in neuroinflammation and amyloid pathologic processes. We also identify a set of late stage pseudotime samples that are controls and show changes in genes enriched for protein trafficking, splicing, regulation of apoptosis, and prevention of amyloid cleavage pathways. In summary, we present a method for ordering patients along a trajectory of LOAD disease progression from brain transcriptomic data.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to perform genome-wide associations (GWAS) and gene-set enrichment analyses with protein composition and cheesemaking-related latent variables (factors; F) in a cohort of 1,011 Italian Brown Swiss cows. Factor analysis was applied to identify latent structures of 26 phenotypes related to bovine milk quantity and quality, protein fractions [αS1-, αS2-, β-, and κ-casein (CN), β-lactoglobulin, and α-lactalbumin (α-LA)], coagulation and curd firming at time t (CFt) measures, and cheese properties [cheese yield (\%CY) and nutrients recovery in the curd] of individual cows. Ten orthogonal F were extracted, explaining 74\% of the original variability. Factor 1\%CY underlined the \%CY characteristics, F2CFt was related to the CFt process parameters, F3Yield was considered as descriptor of milk and solids yield, whereas F4Cheese N underscored the presence of nitrogenous compounds (N) into the cheese. Four more F were related to the milk caseins (F5αS1-β-CN, F7β-κ-CN, F8αS2-CN, and F9αS1-CN-Ph) and 1 F was linked to the whey protein (F10α-LA); 1 F underlined the udder health status (F6Udder health). All cows were genotyped with the Illumina BovineSNP50 Bead Chip v.2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Single marker regression GWAS were fitted. Gene-set enrichment analysis was run on GWAS results, using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway databases, to reveal ontologies or pathways associated with the F. All F but F3Yield showed significance in GWAS. Signals in 10 Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) were detected. High peaks on BTA6 (∼87 Mbp) were found for F6β-κ-CN, F5αS1-β-CN, and at the tail of BTA11 (∼104 Mbp) for F4Cheese N. Gene-set enrichment analyses showed significant results (false discovery rate at 5\%) for F8αS2-CN, F1\%CY, F4Cheese N, and F10α-LA. For F8αS2-CN, 33 Gene Ontology terms and 3 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes categories were enriched, including terms related to ion transport and homeostasis, neuron function or part, and GnRH signaling pathway. Our results support the feasibility of factor analysis as a dimension reduction technique in genomic studies and evidenced a potential key role of αS2-CN in milk quality and composition.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

These variants can be combined into a polygenic risk score that captures part of an individual’s susceptibility to diseases. Polygenic risk scores have been widely applied in research studies, confirming the association between the scores and disease status, but their clinical utility has yet to be established. Polygenic risk scores may be used to estimate an individual’s lifetime genetic risk of disease, but the current discriminative ability is low in the general population. Clinical implementation of polygenic risk score (PRS) may be useful in cohorts where there is a higher prior probability of disease, for example, in early stages of diseases to assist in diagnosis or to inform treatment choices. Important considerations are the weaker evidence base in application to non-European ancestry and the challenges in translating an individual’s PRS from a percentile of a normal distribution to a lifetime disease risk. In this review, we consider how PRS may be informative at different points in the disease trajectory giving examples of progress in the field and discussing obstacles that need to be addressed before clinical implementation.},

A total of 220 virus-enriched preparations from serially collected fecal samples from 11 children (cases) who developed serum autoantibodies associated with T1D (of whom five developed clinical T1D) were compared with samples from controls. Intestinal viromes of case subjects were less diverse than those of controls. Among eukaryotic viruses, we identified significant enrichment of Circoviridae-related sequences in samples from controls in comparison with cases. Enterovirus, kobuvirus, parechovirus, parvovirus, and rotavirus sequences were frequently detected but were not associated with autoimmunity. For bacteriophages, we found higher Shannon diversity and richness in controls compared with cases and observed that changes in the intestinal virome over time differed between cases and controls. Using Random Forests analysis, we identified disease-associated viral bacteriophage contigs after subtraction of age-associated contigs. These disease-associated contigs were statistically linked to specific components of the bacterial microbiome. Thus, changes in the intestinal virome preceded autoimmunity in this cohort. Specific components of the virome were both directly and inversely associated with the development of human autoimmune disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We examined the fecal virome and bacterial community composition of children with Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and healthy controls to test the hypothesis that unique patterns of viral organisms and/or presence of bacterial pathogens may be identified that could contribute to the pathogenesis of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: Fecal samples from 24 children (mean 12.2 years) with CD (n = 7) or UC (n = 5) and similar aged controls (n = 12) were processed to determine individual viromes. Viral sequences were identified through translated protein sequence similarity search. Bacterial microbiota were determined by sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
RESULTS: Only a few human viruses were detected, so virome analyses focused on bacterial viruses. The relative abundance of Caudovirales was greater than that of Microviridae phages in both IBD and healthy controls. Caudovirales phages were more abundant in CD (mean 80.8\%) than UC (48.8\%) (P = 0.05) but not controls. The richness of viral strains in Microviridae but not Caudovirales was higher in controls than CD (P = 0.05) but not UC cases. No other measure of phage abundance, richness, or Shannon diversity showed significant difference between the 2 IBD and control groups. Bacterial microbiota analysis revealed that IBD diagnosis, albumin, hemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and probiotic supplementation correlated to the composition of gut bacterial microbiota.
CONCLUSIONS: Minor patterns in gut virome and bacterial community composition distinguish pediatric IBD patients from healthy controls. Probiotics are associated with bacterial microbiota composition. These exploratory results need confirmation in larger studies.},

We present here DeepRank, a general, configurable deep learning framework for data mining PPIs using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). DeepRank maps features of PPIs onto 3D grids and trains a user-specified CNN on these 3D grids. DeepRank allows for efficient training of 3D CNNs with data sets containing millions of PPIs and supports both classification and regression. We demonstrate the performance of DeepRank on two distinct challenges: The classification of biological versus crystallographic PPIs, and the ranking of docking models. For both problems DeepRank is competitive with, or outperforms, state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the versatility of the framework for research in structural biology.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gaining structural insights into the protein-protein interactome is essential to understand biological phenomena and extract knowledge for rational drug design or protein engineering. We have previously developed DeepRank, a deep-learning framework to facilitate pattern learning from protein-protein interfaces using convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches. However, CNN is not rotation invariant and data augmentation is required to desensitize the network to the input data orientation which dramatically impairs the computation performance. Representing protein-protein complexes as atomic- or residue-scale rotation invariant graphs instead enables using graph neural networks (GNN) approaches, bypassing those limitations.
RESULTS: We have developed DeepRank-GNN, a framework that converts protein-protein interfaces from PDB 3D coordinates files into graphs that are further provided to a pre-defined or user-defined GNN architecture to learn problem-specific interaction patterns. DeepRank-GNN is designed to be highly modularizable, easily customized and is wrapped into a user-friendly python3 package. Here, we showcase DeepRank-GNN's performance on two applications using a dedicated graph interaction neural network: (i) the scoring of docking poses and (ii) the discriminating of biological and crystal interfaces. In addition to the highly competitive performance obtained in those tasks as compared to state-of-the-art methods, we show a significant improvement in speed and storage requirement using DeepRank-GNN as compared to DeepRank.

To understand molecular mechanisms of such functions it is crucial to determine the structure of protein complexes. To complement experimental approaches, which usually take a considerable amount of time and resources, various computational methods have been developed for predicting the structures of protein complexes. In computational modeling, one of the challenges is to identify near-native structures from a large pool of generated models. Here, we developed a deep learning-based approach named Graph Neural Network-based DOcking decoy eValuation scorE (GNN-DOVE). To evaluate a protein docking model, GNN-DOVE extracts the interface area and represents it as a graph. The chemical properties of atoms and the inter-atom distances are used as features of nodes and edges in the graph. GNN-DOVE was trained and tested on docking models in the Dockground database and further tested on a combined dataset of Dockground and ZDOCK benchmark as well as a CAPRI scoring dataset. GNN-DOVE performed better than existing methods including DOVE, which is our previous development that uses a convolutional neural network on voxelized structure models.},

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) quantify the contribution of multiple genetic loci to an individual's likelihood of a complex trait or disease. However, existing PRSs estimate this likelihood with common genetic variants, excluding the impact of rare variants. Here, we report on a method to identify rare variants associated with outlier gene expression and integrate their impact into PRS predictions for body mass index (BMI), obesity, and bariatric surgery. Between the top and bottom 10\%, we observed a 20.8\% increase in risk for obesity (p = 3 × 10-14), 62.3\% increase in risk for severe obesity (p = 1 × 10-6), and median 5.29 years earlier onset for bariatric surgery (p = 0.008), as a function of expression outlier-associated rare variant burden when controlling for common variant PRS. We show that these predictions were more significant than integrating the effects of rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs), observing a mean 19\% increase in phenotypic variance explained with expression outlier-associated rare variants when compared with PTVs (p = 2 × 10-15). We replicated these findings by using data from the Million Veteran Program and demonstrated that PRSs across multiple traits and diseases can benefit from the inclusion of expression outlier-associated rare variants identified through population-scale transcriptome sequencing.},

	abstract = {Genome sequencing is enabling precision medicine-tailoring treatment to the unique constellation of variants in an individual's genome. The impact of recurrent pathogenic variants is often understood, however there is a long tail of rare genetic variants that are uncharacterized. The problem of uncharacterized rare variation is especially acute when it occurs in genes of known clinical importance with functionally consequential variants and associated mechanisms. Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in these genes are discovered at a rate that outpaces current ability to classify them with databases of previous cases, experimental evaluation, and computational predictors. Clinicians are thus left without guidance about the significance of variants that may have actionable consequences. Computational prediction of the impact of rare genetic variation is increasingly becoming an important capability. In this paper, we review the technical and ethical challenges of interpreting the function of rare variants in two settings: inborn errors of metabolism in newborns and pharmacogenomics. We propose a framework for a genomic learning healthcare system with an initial focus on early-onset treatable disease in newborns and actionable pharmacogenomics. We argue that (1) a genomic learning healthcare system must allow for continuous collection and assessment of rare variants, (2) emerging machine learning methods will enable algorithms to predict the clinical impact of rare variants on protein function, and (3) ethical considerations must inform the construction and deployment of all rare-variation triage strategies, particularly with respect to health disparities arising from unbalanced ancestry representation.},

We then ran GWASs on 56 complex traits in up to 254,387 British individuals. Controlling for geographic regions significantly decreased the heritability for socioeconomic status (SES)-related traits, most strongly for educational attainment and income. For most traits, controlling for regions significantly reduced genetic correlations with educational attainment and income, most significantly for body mass index/body fat, sedentary behavior and substance use, consistent with gene–environment correlations related to regional socio-economic differences. The effects of controlling for birthplace and current address suggest both passive and active sources of gene–environment correlations.

Here, we evaluate genome-wide SNP annotations from two previous deep learning models, DeepSEA and Basenji, by applying stratified LD score regression to 41 diseases and traits (average N = 320K), conditioning on a broad set of coding, conserved and regulatory annotations. We aggregated annotations across all (respectively blood or brain) tissues/cell-types in meta-analyses across all (respectively 11 blood or 8 brain) traits. The annotations were highly enriched for disease heritability, but produced only limited conditionally significant results: non-tissue-specific and brain-specific Basenji-H3K4me3 for all traits and brain traits respectively. We conclude that deep learning models have yet to achieve their full potential to provide considerable unique information for complex disease, and that their conditional informativeness for disease cannot be inferred from their accuracy in predicting regulatory annotations.},

Here we present BERTax, a deep neural network program based on natural language processing to precisely classify the superkingdom and phylum of DNA sequences taxonomically without the need for a known representative relative from a database. We show BERTax to be at least on par with the state-of-the-art approaches when taxonomically similar species are part of the training data. For novel organisms, however, BERTax clearly outperforms any existing approach. Finally, we show that BERTax can also be combined with database approaches to further increase the prediction quality in almost all cases. Since BERTax is not based on similar entries in databases, it allows precise taxonomic classification of a broader range of genomic sequences, thus increasing the overall information gain.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The implications of selection bias due to volunteering (volunteer bias) for genetic association studies are poorly understood. Because of its large sample size and extensive phenotyping, the UK Biobank (UKB) is included in almost all large genomewide association studies (GWAS) to date, as it is one of the largest cohorts. Yet, it is known to be highly selected. We develop inverse probability weighted GWAS (WGWAS) to estimate GWAS summary statistics in the UKB that are corrected for volunteer bias. WGWAS decreases the effective sample size substantially compared to GWAS by an average of 61\% (from 337,543 to 130,684) depending on the phenotype. The extent to which volunteer bias affects GWAS associations and downstream results is phenotype-specific. Through WGWAS we find 11 novel genomewide significant loci for type 1 diabetes and 3 for breast cancer. These loci were not identified previously in any prior GWAS. Further, genetic variant’s effect sizes and heritability estimates become more predictive in WGWAS for certain phenotypes (e.g., educational attainment, drinks per week, breast cancer and type 1 diabetes). WGWAS also alters biological annotation relations in gene-set analyses. This suggests that not accounting for volunteer-based selection can result in GWASs that suffer from bias, which in turn may drive spurious associations. GWAS consortia may therefore wish to provide population weights for their data sets or rely more on population-representative samples.},

Despite being agnostic to evolutionary conservation, JARVIS performs comparably or outperforms conservation-based scores in classifying pathogenic single-nucleotide and structural variants. In constructing JARVIS, we introduce the genome-wide residual variation intolerance score (gwRVIS), applying a sliding-window approach to whole genome sequencing data from 62,784 individuals. gwRVIS distinguishes Mendelian disease genes from more tolerant CCDS regions and highlights ultra-conserved non-coding elements as the most intolerant regions in the human genome. Both JARVIS and gwRVIS capture previously inaccessible human-lineage constraint information and will enhance our understanding of the non-coding genome.},

	abstract = {The expanding catalog of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provides biological insights across a variety of species, but identifying the causal variants behind these associations remains a significant challenge. Experimental validation is both labor-intensive and costly, highlighting the need for accurate, scalable computational methods to predict the effects of genetic variants across the entire genome. Inspired by recent progress in natural language processing, unsupervised pretraining on large protein sequence databases has proven successful in extracting complex information related to proteins. These models showcase their ability to learn variant effects in coding regions using an unsupervised approach. Expanding on this idea, we here introduce the Genomic Pre-trained Network (GPN), a model designed to learn genome-wide variant effects through unsupervised pretraining on genomic DNA sequences. Our model also successfully learns gene structure and DNA motifs without any supervision. To demonstrate its utility, we train GPN on unaligned reference genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and seven related species within the Brassicales order and evaluate its ability to predict the functional impact of genetic variants in A. thaliana by utilizing allele frequencies from the 1001 Genomes Project and a comprehensive database of GWAS. Notably, GPN outperforms predictors based on popular conservation scores such as phyloP and phastCons. Our predictions for A. thaliana can be visualized as sequence logos in the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/gbenegas/gpn-arabidopsis). We provide code (https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn) to train GPN for any given species using its DNA sequence alone, enabling unsupervised prediction of variant effects across the entire genome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk score (PRS) quantifies the cumulative effects of common genetic variants across the genome, including both coding and non-coding regions, to predict the risk of developing common diseases. In cardiovascular medicine, PRS enhances risk stratification beyond traditional clinical risk factors, offering a precision medicine approach to coronary artery disease (CAD) prevention. This study evaluates the predictive performance of a multi-ancestry PRS framework for cardiovascular risk assessment using the All of Us (AoU) short-read whole-genome sequencing dataset comprising over 225,000 participants.
METHODS: We developed PRSs for lipid traits (LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides) and cardiometabolic conditions (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation) and constructed two metaPRSs: one integrating lipid and cardiometabolic PRSs (risk factor metaPRS) and another incorporating CAD PRSs in addition to these risk factors (risk factor + CAD metaPRS). Predictive performance was evaluated separately for each trait-specific PRS and for both metaPRSs to assess their effectiveness in CAD risk prediction across diverse ancestries. Model predictive performance, including calibration, was assessed separately for each ancestry group, ensuring that all metrics were ancestry-specific and that PRSs remain generalizable across diverse populations Results: PRSs for lipids and cardiometabolic conditions demonstrated strong predictive performance across ancestries. The risk factors metaPRS predicted CAD risk across multiple ancestries. The addition of a CAD-specific PRS to the risk factors metaPRS improved predictive performance, highlighting a genetic component in CAD etiopathology that is not fully captured by traditional risk factors, whether clinically measured or genetically inferred. Model calibration and validation across ancestries confirmed the broad applicability of PRS-based approaches in multi-ethnic populations.
CONCLUSION: PRS-based risk stratification provides a reliable, ancestry-inclusive framework for personalized cardiovascular disease prevention, enabling better targeted interventions such as pharmacological therapy and lifestyle modifications. By incorporating genetic information from both coding and non-coding regions, PRSs refine risk prediction across diverse populations, advancing the integration of genomics into precision medicine for common diseases.},

A variety of epidemiological and experimental evidence supports this hypothesis. Nevertheless, there are a number of conflicting reports regarding the degree of immune protection conferred, the immune cell types responsible for protection, and the potential contributions of immunosuppressive therapies to tumor induction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the adaptive immune system actively suppresses tumorigenesis in a Sleeping Beauty (SB) mouse model of cancer. SB transposon mutagenesis was performed in either a wild-type or immunocompromised (Rag2-null) background. Tumor latency and multiplicity were remarkably similar in both immune cohorts, suggesting that the adaptive immune system is not efficiently suppressing tumor formation in our model. Exceptions included skin tumors, which displayed increased multiplicity in wild-type animals, and leukemias, which developed with shorter latency in immune-deficient mice. Overall tumor distribution was also altered such that tumors affecting the gastrointestinal tract were more frequent and hemangiosarcomas were less frequent in immune-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Finally, genetic profiling of transposon-induced mutations identified significant differences in mutation prevalence for a number of genes, including Uba1. Taken together, these results indicate that B and T cells function to shape the genetic profile of tumors in various tumor types, despite being ineffective at clearing SB-induced tumors. To our knowledge, this study represents the first forward genetic screen designed to examine tumor immunosurveillance mechanisms.},

In contrast with bulk RNAseq, single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) allows paired chain analyses, yielding a more accurate measure of the repertoire. Interestingly, ∼30\% of mature peripheral T cells express multiple TCR alleles (e.g., two α-chains) and may exhibit dual Ag specificity. scRNAseq has become increasingly common, and data from both human and animal studies are publicly available. However, routine workflows discard secondary TCR alleles and focus on a single TCR clone per cell.

One challenge limiting immunotherapy success is that tumors lacking T-cell infiltration do not respond to treatment. Therefore, one potential strategy to overcome resistance is to enhance the ability of T cells to traffic into tumors. Here, we describe an unbiased in vivo genetic screen approach utilizing the Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis system to identify candidate genes in T cells that might be modified to drive intratumoral T-cell accumulation. This screen identified over 400 candidate genes in three tumor models. These results indicated substantial variation in gene candidate selection, depending on the tumor model and whether or not mice were treated with anti–PD-1, yet some candidate genes were identified in all tumor models and with anti–PD-1 therapy. Inhibition of the most frequently mutated gene, Aak1, affected chemokine receptor expression and enhanced T-cell trafficking in vitro and in vivo. Screen candidates should be further validated as therapeutic targets, with particular relevance to enhancing infiltration of adoptively transferred T cells into solid tumors.},

This resulted in a combined total of 1,523 candidate genes – including 1,464 genes not currently being evaluated as therapeutic targets - that may improve tumor infiltration of T cells.

We also describe an original mouse model of invasive keratoacanthoma driven by skin-specific expression of the truncated Zmiz1 transcript. Unlike most mouse models, Zmiz1-induced skin tumors develop rapidly and in the absence of promoting agents such as phorbol esters. In addition, we found that the alternative Zmiz1 isoform has greater protein stability than its full-length counterpart. Finally, we provide evidence that ZMIZ1 is overexpressed in a significant percentage of human breast, ovarian, and colon cancers in addition to human SCCs, suggesting that ZMIZ1 may play a broader role in epithelial cancers.},

To assess the role of three SNP-associated complement-regulatory proteins (CFH, CFHR1, and CFHR3) in clinical response to anti-CD20 mAb, we studied two cohorts of patients treated with anti-CD20 mAb.Experimental Design: Cohorts included the Iowa/Mayo Lymphoma SPORE observational cohort of subjects with a new diagnosis of follicular lymphoma treated with rituximab and the GAUSS prospective randomized trial cohort of follicular lymphoma subjects randomized to receive single-agent rituximab or obinutuzumab. Circulating protein expression was measured for CFH, CFHR1, and CFHR3 and correlated to clinical outcome.Results: rs3766404 genotype correlated with expression of the related downstream genes CFHR1 and CFHR3 Loss of CFHR1 expression correlated with inferior patient outcome in the observational cohort, but not in the GAUSS cohort. Loss of CFHR3 correlated with superior event-free survival in GAUSS subjects treated with obinutuzumab, but not rituximab.Conclusions: We conclude that the relationship between complement-regulatory proteins CFHR1 and CFHR3 and response to anti-CD20 mAb therapy varies based on the specific anti-CD20 mAb used. We propose that CFHR3 is a candidate biomarker for obinutuzumab response. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and to better understand how complement pathways and complement-regulatory proteins impact on the efficacy of anti-CD20 mAb therapy.

	abstract = {Network embedding approaches are gaining momentum to analyse a large variety of networks. Indeed, these approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in tasks such as community detection, node classification, and link prediction. However, very few network embedding methods have been specifically designed to handle multiplex networks, i.e. networks composed of different layers sharing the same set of nodes but having different types of edges. Moreover, to our knowledge, existing approaches cannot embed multiple nodes from multiplex-heterogeneous networks, i.e. networks composed of several multiplex networks containing both different types of nodes and edges. In this study, we propose MultiVERSE, an extension of the VERSE framework using Random Walks with Restart on Multiplex (RWR-M) and Multiplex-Heterogeneous (RWR-MH) networks. MultiVERSE is a fast and scalable method to learn node embeddings from multiplex and multiplex-heterogeneous networks. We evaluate MultiVERSE on several biological and social networks and demonstrate its performance. MultiVERSE indeed outperforms most of the other methods in the tasks of link prediction and network reconstruction for multiplex network embedding, and is also efficient in link prediction for multiplex-heterogeneous network embedding. Finally, we apply MultiVERSE to study rare disease-gene associations using link prediction and clustering. MultiVERSE is freely available on github at https://github.com/Lpiol/MultiVERSE.},

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases — complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease.

	abstract = {As genome-wide association studies have continued to identify loci associated with complex traits, the implications of and necessity for proper use of these findings, including prediction of disease risk, have become apparent. Many complex diseases have numerous associated loci with detectable effects implicating risk for or protection from disease. A common contemporary approach to using this information for disease prediction is through the application of genetic risk scores. These scores estimate an individual's liability for a specific outcome by aggregating the effects of associated loci into a single measure as described in the previous version of this article. Although genetic risk scores have traditionally included variants that meet criteria for genome-wide significance, an extension known as the polygenic risk score has been developed to include the effects of more variants across the entire genome. Here, we describe common methods and software packages for calculating and interpreting polygenic risk scores. In this revised version of the article, we detail information that is needed to perform a polygenic risk score analysis, considerations for planning the analysis and interpreting results, as well as discussion of the limitations based on the choices made. We also provide simulated sample data and a walkthrough for four different polygenic risk score software. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC. This article was corrected on 28 July 2022.

The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R(2) increased from 20.1\% to 25.3\% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8\% to 12.0\% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples.

They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.},

Genetic variants in functional regions of the genome are enriched for complex trait heritability. Here, we introduce a method for polygenic prediction, LDpred-funct, that leverages trait-specific functional priors to increase prediction accuracy. We fit priors using the recently developed baseline-LD model, including coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related annotations. We analytically estimate posterior mean causal effect sizes and then use cross-validation to regularize these estimates, improving prediction accuracy for sparse architectures. We applied LDpred-funct to predict 21 highly heritable traits in the UK Biobank (avg N = 373 K as training data). LDpred-funct attained a +4.6\% relative improvement in average prediction accuracy (avg prediction R2 = 0.144; highest R2 = 0.413 for height) compared to SBayesR (the best method that does not incorporate functional information). For height, meta-analyzing training data from UK Biobank and 23andMe cohorts (N = 1107 K) increased prediction R2 to 0.431.

We address this via a machine learning approach, validated in nine complex phenotypes in a multi-ancestry population. We use an ensemble method of SNP selection followed by gradient boosted trees (XGBoost) to allow for non-linearities and interaction effects. We compare our results to the standard, linear PRS model developed using PRSice, LDpred2, and lassosum2. Combining a PRS as a feature in an XGBoost model results in a relative increase in the percentage variance explained compared to the standard linear PRS model by 22\% for height, 27\% for HDL cholesterol, 43\% for body mass index, 50\% for sleep duration, 58\% for systolic blood pressure, 64\% for total cholesterol, 66\% for triglycerides, 77\% for LDL cholesterol, and 100\% for diastolic blood pressure. Multi-ancestry trained models perform similarly to specific racial/ethnic group trained models and are consistently superior to the standard linear PRS models.

	abstract = {Augmenting traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with advanced machine learning algorithms can allow the detection of novel signals in available cohorts. We introduce “genome-wide association neural networks (GWANN)” a novel approach that uses neural networks (NNs) to perform a gene-level association study with family history of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In UK Biobank, we defined cases (n = 42 110) as those with AD or family history of AD and sampled an equal number of controls. The data was split into an 80:20 ratio of training and testing samples, and GWANN was trained on the former followed by identifying associated genes using its performance on the latter. Our method identified 18 genes to be associated with family history of AD. APOE, BIN1, SORL1, ADAM10, APH1B, and SPI1 have been identified by previous AD GWAS. Among the 12 new genes, PCDH9, NRG3, ROR1, LINGO2, SMYD3, and LRRC7 have been associated with neurofibrillary tangles or phosphorylated tau in previous studies. Furthermore, there is evidence for differential transcriptomic or proteomic expression between AD and healthy brains for 10 of the 12 new genes. A series of post hoc analyses resulted in a significantly enriched protein–protein interaction network (P-value \&lt; 1 × 10−16), and enrichment of relevant disease and biological pathways such as focal adhesion (P-value = 1 × 10−4), extracellular matrix organization (P-value = 1 × 10−4), Hippo signaling (P-value = 7 × 10−4), Alzheimer’s disease (P-value = 3 × 10−4), and impaired cognition (P-value = 4 × 10−3). Applying NNs for GWAS illustrates their potential to complement existing algorithms and methods and enable the discovery of new associations without the need to expand existing cohorts.},

We applied the framework to seventeen phenotypes and found well-replicated genes such as HERC2 and OCA2 for hair and eye color, and novel genes such as ZNF773 and PCNT for schizophrenia. Additionally, the framework identified ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, endocrine system and viral infectious diseases as most predictive biological pathways for schizophrenia.

	abstract = {Molecular subtyping of cancer is a critical step towards more individualized therapy and provides important biological insights into cancer heterogeneity. Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples. Here, we describe a novel supervised cancer classification framework, deep cancer subtype classification (DeepCC), based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways. In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms. Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of DeepCC to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by DeepCC captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously. In summary, DeepCC provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping.},

	abstract = {Protein language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful approaches for mapping protein sequences into embeddings suitable for various applications. As protein representation schemes, PLMs generate per-token (i.e. per-residue) representations, resulting in variable-sized outputs based on protein length. This variability poses a challenge for protein-level prediction tasks that require uniform-sized embeddings for consistent analysis across different proteins. Previous work has typically used average pooling to summarize token-level PLM outputs, but it is unclear whether this method effectively prioritizes the relevant information across token-level representations.We introduce a novel method utilizing optimal transport to convert variable-length PLM outputs into fixed-length representations. We conceptualize per-token PLM outputs as samples from a probabilistic distribution and employ sliced-Wasserstein distances to map these samples against a reference set, creating a Euclidean embedding in the output space. The resulting embedding is agnostic to the length of the input and represents the entire protein. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over average pooling for several downstream prediction tasks, particularly with constrained PLM sizes, enabling smaller-scale PLMs to match or exceed the performance of average-pooled larger-scale PLMs. Our aggregation scheme is especially effective for longer protein sequences by capturing essential information that might be lost through average pooling.Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/navid-naderi/PLM\_SWE.},

	abstract = {Protein language models (PLMs) are amongst the most exciting recent advances for characterizing protein sequences, and have enabled a diverse set of applications, including structure determination, functional property prediction, and mutation impact assessment, all from single protein sequences alone. State-of-the-art PLMs leverage transformer architectures originally developed for natural language processing, and are pre-trained on large protein databases to generate contextualized representations of individual amino acids. To harness the power of these PLMs to predict protein-level properties, these per-residue embeddings are typically “pooled” to fixed-size vectors that are further utilized in downstream prediction networks. Common pooling strategies include Cls-Pooling and Avg-Pooling, but neither of these approaches can capture the local substructures and long-range interactions observed in proteins.We propose the use of attention pooling, which can naturally capture these important features of proteins. To make the expensive attention operator (quadratic in the length of the input protein) feasible in practice, we introduce bag-of-mer pooling, or BoM-Pooling, a locality-aware hierarchical pooling technique that combines windowed average pooling with attention pooling. We empirically demonstrate that both full attention pooling and BoM-Pooling outperform previous pooling strategies on three important, diverse tasks: (i) predicting the activities of two proteins as they are varied; (ii) detecting remote homologs; and (iii) predicting signaling protein interactions with peptides. Overall, our work highlights the advantages of biologically inspired pooling techniques in protein sequence modeling and is a step toward more effective adaptations of language models in biological settings.https://github.com/Singh-Lab/bom-pooling.},

However, most applications rely on expensive fine-tuning, which works best when the training and test data share a similar distribution. In this work, we investigate whether task-specific fine-tuning is always necessary. We show that simple embedding-based pipelines that extract fixed representations from these models and feed them into lightweight classifiers can achieve competitive performance. In evaluation settings with different data distributions, embedding-based methods often outperform fine-tuning while reducing inference time by 10x to 20x. Our results suggest that embedding extraction is not only a strong baseline but also a more generalizable and efficient alternative to fine-tuning, especially for deployment in diverse or unseen genomic contexts. For example, in enhancer classification, HyenaDNA embeddings combined with zCurve achieve 0.68 accuracy (vs. 0.58 for fine-tuning), with an 88\% reduction in inference time and over 8x lower carbon emissions (0.02 kg vs. 0.17 kg CO2). In non-TATA promoter classification, DNABERT-2 embeddings with zCurve or GC content reach 0.85 accuracy (vs. 0.89 with fine-tuning) with a 22x lower carbon footprint (0.02 kg vs. 0.44 kg CO2). These results show that embedding-based pipelines offer over 10x better carbon efficiency while maintaining strong predictive performance.

This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence. DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100\% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18\% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60\% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20\% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40\% agreements.

PRS have the potential to address possible misclassification of T1D and T2D. Here we evaluated PRS models for T1D and T2D in European genetic ancestry participants from the UK Biobank (UKB) and then in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI). Specifically, we investigated the utility of T1D and T2D PRS to discriminate between T1D, T2D, and controls in unrelated UKB individuals of European ancestry. We derived PRS models using external non-UKB GWAS. The T1D PRS model with the best discrimination between T1D cases and controls (area under the receiver operator curve [AUC] = 0.805) also yielded the best discrimination of T1D from T2D cases in the UKB (AUC = 0.792) and separation in MGI (AUC = 0.686). In contrast, the best T2D model did not discriminate between T1D and T2D cases (AUC = 0.527). Our analysis suggests that a T1D PRS model based on independent single nucleotide polymorphisms may help differentiate between T1D, T2D, and controls in individuals of European genetic ancestry.},

While traditionally derived from imputed array genotypes, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) provides a more direct approach and is now increasingly used in clinical and research studies.

In the overall cohort, WGS-based T1DGRS demonstrated strong correlation with TOPMed-imputed array-based score (r = 0.996, average WGS-based score 0.0028 standard deviations (SD) lower, p {\textless} 10− 31), while showing lower correlation with 1000 Genomes-imputed array-based scores (r = 0.981, 0.043 SD lower in WGS, p {\textless} 10− 300). Ancestry-stratified analyses between WGS-based and TOPMed-imputed array-based score showed the highest correlation with European ancestry (r = 0.996, 0.044 SD lower in WGS, p {\textless} 10− 300) followed by African ancestry (r = 0.989, 0.0193 SD lower in WGS, p {\textless} 10− 14) and South Asian ancestry (r = 0.986, 0.0129 SD lower in WGS, p {\textless} 10 − 6). These differences were more pronounced when comparing WGS based score with 1000 Genomes-imputed array-based scores (r = 0.982, 0.975, 0.957 for European, South Asian, African respectively). Population-level analysis using WGS-based T1DGRS revealed significant ancestry-based stratification, with European ancestry individuals showing the highest scores, followed by South Asian (average 0.28 SD lower than Europeans, p {\textless} 10− 58) and African ancestry individuals (average 0.89 SD lower than Europeans, p {\textless} 10− 300). Notably, when applying the European ancestry-derived 90th centile risk threshold, only 0.71\% (95\% CI 0.41–1.13) of African ancestry individuals and 6.4\% (95\% CI 5.6–7.2) of South Asian individuals were identified as high-risk, substantially below the expected 10\%. In conclusion, while WGS is viable for generating T1DGRS, with TOPMed-imputed genotypes offering a cost-effective alternative, the persistence of ancestry-based variations in T1DGRS distribution even using whole genome sequencing emphasises the need for ancestry-specific or pan-ancestry standards in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Background Precise risk prediction of type 1 diabetes (T1D) facilitates early intervention and identification of risk factors prior to irreversible beta-islet cell destruction, and can significantly improve T1D prevention and clinical care. Sharp et al. developed a genetic risk scoring (GRS) system for T1D (T1D-GRS2) capable of predicting T1D risk in children of European ancestry. The T1D-GRS2 was developed on the basis of causal genetic variants, thus may be applicable to minor populations, while a trans-ethnic GRS for T1D may avoid the exacerbation of health disparities due to the lack of genomic information in minorities. Methods Here, we describe a T1D-GRS2 calculator validated in two independent cohorts, including African American children and European American children. Participants were recruited by the Center for Applied Genomics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Results It demonstrates that GRS2 is applicable to the T1D risk prediction in the AA cohort, while population-specific thresholds are needed for different populations. Conclusions The study highlights the potential to further improve T1D-GRS2 performance with the inclusion of additional genetic markers.},

Here we present a systematic framework to extract and analyze interpretable features from PLMs using sparse autoencoders. Training sparse autoencoders on ESM-2 embeddings, we identify thousands of interpretable features highlighting biological concepts including binding sites, structural motifs and functional domains. Individual neurons show considerably less conceptual alignment, suggesting PLMs store concepts in superposition. This superposition persists across model scales and larger PLMs capture more interpretable concepts. Beyond known annotations, ESM-2 learns coherent patterns across evolutionarily distinct protein families. To systematically analyze these numerous features, we developed an automated interpretation approach using large language models for feature description and validation. As practical applications, these features can accurately identify missing database annotations and enable targeted steering of sequence generation. Our results show PLM representations can be decomposed into interpretable components, demonstrating the feasibility and utility of mechanistically interpreting these models.},

While conventional artificial intelligence (AI) models excel in many prediction tasks, they often lack interpretability and are blind to the scientific hypotheses generated by researchers to enable cancer discoveries. Here we propose that hypothesis-driven AI, a new emerging class of AI algorithm, is an innovative approach to uncovering the complex etiology of cancer from big omics data. This review exemplifies how hypothesis-driven AI is different from conventional AI by citing its application in various areas of oncology including tumor classification, patient stratification, cancer gene discovery, drug response prediction, and tumor spatial organization. Our aim is to stress the feasibility of incorporating domain knowledge and scientific hypotheses to craft the design of new AI algorithms. We showcase the power of hypothesis-driven AI in making novel cancer discoveries that can be overlooked by conventional AI methods. Since hypothesis-driven AI is still in its infancy, open questions such as how to better incorporate new knowledge and biological perspectives to ameliorate bias and improve interpretability in the design of AI algorithms still need to be addressed. In conclusion, hypothesis-driven AI holds great promise in the discovery of new mechanistic and functional insights that explain the complexity of cancer etiology and potentially chart a new roadmap to improve treatment regimens for individual patients.},

The principles of symmetry have guided numerous important discoveries in physics and chemistry but not in biology and medicine. Here, we aim to explore the presence of symmetry relationships at the gene expression level as a mean to distinguish between healthy and disease states. We deployed Learning-Based Invariant Feature Engineering - LIFE, a hybrid machine learning approach implemented with two symmetric invariant feature functions (IFFs) to identify Invariant Feature Genes (IFGs), which are gene pairs whose IFF single-value outputs remain invariant across individual samples in a given biological phenotype. Our multiclass classification results across the transcriptomes of 25 normal organs, 25 cancer types, and blood samples obtained from 4 different types of neurodegenerative diseases revealed the presence of unique phenotype-specific IFGs. We constructed networks using these IFGs (IF-Nets) and intriguingly, we demonstrated that the hubs could serve as information encoders, capable of reconstructing sample-wise expression values in relation to their counterpart genes. More importantly, we found that hubs of cancer IF-Nets were enriched with both approved and clinical trial drugs, highlighting “symmetry breaking” as a novel approach for treating diseases.},

	abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a small fraction of the total cancer cell population, yet they are thought to drive disease propagation, therapy resistance and relapse. Like healthy stem cells, CSCs possess the ability to self-renew and differentiate. These stemness phenotypes of CSCs rely on multiple molecular cues, including signaling pathways (for example, WNT, Notch and Hedgehog), cell surface molecules that interact with cellular niche components, and microenvironmental interactions with immune cells. Despite the importance of understanding CSC biology, our knowledge of how neighboring immune and tumor cell populations collectively shape CSC stemness is incomplete. Here, we provide a systems biology perspective on the crucial roles of cellular population identification and dissection of cell regulatory states. By reviewing state-of-the-art single-cell technologies, we show how innovative systems-based analysis enables a deeper understanding of the stemness of the tumor niche and the influence of intratumoral cancer cell and immune cell compositions. We also summarize strategies for refining CSC systems biology, and the potential role of this approach in the development of improved anticancer treatments. Because CSCs are amenable to cellular transitions, we envision how systems pharmacology can become a major engine for discovery of novel targets and drug candidates that can modulate state transitions for tumor cell reprogramming. Our aim is to provide deeper insights into cancer stemness from a systems perspective. We believe this approach has great potential to guide the development of more effective personalized cancer therapies that can prevent CSC-mediated relapse.},

	abstract = {Hybridization (FISH), a gold standard imaging platform for ecDNA detection, with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a power technique for image segmentation, to build a novel postprocessing automation pipeline for ecDNA detection. The autodetection of ecDNA in metaphase FISH images remains a challenging task due to high levels of noise and considerable cell-to-cell variation. These factors complicate image processing and signal detection, making accurate analysis difficult. The proposed automated pipeline, MIA, is an advance from traditional, laborintensive karyotyping methods. The authors successfully applied their methodology to quantify alterations in ecDNA counts before and after drug treatment (JQ1) across four distinct cancer cell lines: a lung cancer cell line (NCI-H2170), a gastric cancer cell line (SNU16), and colorectal cancer cell lines (NCI-H716, COLO320DM). MIA offers a robust approach to quantify ecDNA and provides a means to enhance our understanding of how cancer cells adapt to therapeutic pressures. This approach yields valuable insights for drug discovery and the development of cancer treatment strategies.Mathematical models are indispensable tools for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex disease and therapeutic responses. These models allow researchers to quantify and simulate biological processes that can contribute to disease progression and can be particularly valuable in assessing the efficacy of various pharmacological agents within treatment strategies. Thomas and Ford Versypt (6) devised a mathematical model using a hypothesis-driven systems pharmacology approach to interrogate the long-lasting effect of high glucose levels in glomerular fibrosis and model the drug action in this disease context. Glomerular fibrosis refers to tissue damage, leading to scarring and thickening of the glomeruli in the kidneys. This condition commonly occurs in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), where effective treatments are currently lacking. The progressive kidney damage in DKD is mediated by host-mediated stimuli, such as advanced glycation end products (AGE), hypertension, angiotensin, and enhanced oxidative stress. These factors contribute to glomerular fibrosis and further exacerbate kidney dysfunction. To address the current clinical challenges, the authors developed a mechanistic mathematical model of diabetes-induced kidney damage by adapting a previously established model on interstitial fibrosis in lupus (7). This model was tailored to glomerular fibrosis using a system of ordinary differential equations and focuses on relevant kidney cell populations to model the complexity of the disease and progression of glomerular fibrosis in diabetes. Their model recapitulated what has been observed in the clinic. There is a lag phase in the recovery of damage caused by high blood glucose levels, where good blood glucose control does not lead to immediate recovery from glomerular fibrosis in the context of diabetes. Interestingly, their model also predicted that inhibition of AGE production is not an effective approach for accelerating the recovery from glomerular fibrosis, possibly due to the slow breakdown of these species. Another model prediction suggests that a therapeutic approach that enhances AGE degradation could theoretically be highly effective in reversing glomerular fibrosis. Importantly, the model provided important insights into why glucose control and aminoguanidine treatment are ineffective in the short term for reversing advanced glomerular fibrosis.Orman et al (8) delved into the complexity of molecular landscapes by extracting multigene coalteration patterns associated with the aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa). The goal of this work was to uncover crucial biological signals that underlie the mechanism of disease progression. The authors, developed ProstaMine, a system biology and integrative genomic tool designed to systematically identify co-alterations of genes that are associated with aggressiveness in PCa. This tool focused on molecular subtypes of PCa, defined by high-fidelity alterations in primary PCa enabling deeper understanding of genetic alterations driving disease progression. ProstaMine leverages multi-omics (genomic, transcriptomic) along with clinical data from five primary and one metastatic PCa cohort, to prioritize co-alterations that are enriched in metastatic disease. ProstaMine was applied to PCa subtypes with NKX3-1-loss and RB1-loss and successfully identified co-altered genes that function in canonical PCa signaling pathways such as MAPK, NF-kB, p53, SMAD, and PI3K. Notably, ProstaMine identified novel subtypespecific co-alterations in p53, STAT6, and MHC class I antigen presentation associated with aggressiveness in RB1-loss PCa. By combining five independent molecular profiling studies in primary PCa, the authors showed that ProstaMine can systematically identify high-confidence alteration hotspots across primary PCa genomes and can detect clinicopathologic features related to aggressiveness. Importantly, the authors showed the ability of ProstaMine to mine any userselected molecular subtype. ProstaMine can provide insights into subtype-specific mechanisms of PCa progression and aggressiveness, which can be further formulated into testable experimental hypotheses for further clinical discovery and therapeutic strategies.Finally, array-based platforms are capable of interrogating hundreds of thousands of loci across the human genome in a cost-effective and large-scale manner, spurring genetic studies in the areas such as pharmacogenomics, nutrigenetics, and in complex disease risk prediction. Establishing effective clinical reporting workflows requires comprehensive validation studies to accurately assess assay performance. Accordingly, Gan et al (9) conducted a systematic study aimed at the development and validation of a clinical reporting workflow for pharmacogenomics testing. The workflow utilizes the Illumina Global Screening Array (GSA) chip, a widely available and cost-effective solution for genetic testing. Their work focuses on 503 distinct genetic variants across 25 pharmacogenomic-related (PGx) genes associated with 303 clinically actionable drugs. This study reports accuracy and precision assessments of their GSA-based platform using wellestablished reference materials. This information is not available from previous studies and was critical to define robustness of the Illumina GSA chip in preemptive pharmacogenomics testing. The authors presented their results of accuracy and precision assessments across a total of 73 cell lines. Their evaluations also included reference materials such as the Genome-In-A-Bottle (GIAB), the Genetic Testing Reference Material Coordination Program (GeT-RM) projects, and additional samples from the 1000 Genomes project (1KGP). In addition, the authors also conducted an accuracy assessment of genotype calls for target loci in each indication against established truth sets. In their per-sample analysis, they observed a mean analytical sensitivity of 99.39\% and specificity 99.98\%. Further, they assessed the accuracy of star-allele calls by relying on established diplotypes in the GeT-RM catalogue or calls made based on 1KGP genotyping. On average, the authors detected a diplotype concordance rate of 96.47\% across 14 pharmacogenomic-related genes with a set of selected alleles calls (star allele-calls). Lastly, the authors evaluated the reproducibility of their findings across replicates and observed 99.48\% diplotype and 100\% phenotype inter-run concordance, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the developed workflow.Overall, works published in this Research Topic highlight various challenges that have inspired the development of AI and systems biology tools that offer new clinical insights for hypothesis formulation and testing. These works do not mark the conclusion of this research topic; rather, they serve as a foundation for future exploration and development. For example, questions remain about how to integrate generative AI and large language models (LLMs) into systems biology tools, and advanced multi-omics data analyses and integration. This would enable hypothesis formulation and help uncover multi-factorial factors that underly disease etiology and progression. We believe this vision will ignite the next wave of interest in AI-powered systems biology research.},

CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection.

	abstract = {The Cistrome Data Browser (DB) is a resource of human and mouse cis-regulatory information derived from ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and ATAC-seq chromatin profiling assays, which map the genome-wide locations of transcription factor binding sites, histone post-translational modifications and regions of chromatin accessible to endonuclease activity. Currently, the Cistrome DB contains approximately 47,000 human and mouse samples with about 24,000 newly collected datasets compared to the previous release two years ago. Furthermore, the Cistrome DB has a new Toolkit module with several features that allow users to better utilize the large-scale ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq data. First, users can query the factors which are likely to regulate a specific gene of interest. Second, the Cistrome DB Toolkit facilitates searches for factor binding, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility in any given genomic interval shorter than 2Mb. Third, the Toolkit can determine the most similar ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq samples in terms of genomic interval overlaps with user-provided genomic interval sets. The Cistrome DB is a user-friendly, up-to-date, and well maintained resource, and the new tools will greatly benefit the biomedical research community. The database is freely available at http://cistrome.org/db, and the Toolkit is at http://dbtoolkit.cistrome.org.},

	abstract = {The advent of high-throughput sequencing has led to an exponential increase in genomic data, highlighting the need for efficient and accurate models to analyze and interpret this information. In this study, we introduce a novel, exomic foundational model that leverages a combination of the human reference genome and multispecies data to improve variant detection and interpretation. Our model utilizes a short-range transformer architecture and is trained on a large dataset of human exomic sequences derived from the Tapestry study. Through a series of ablation studies and scaling experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in predicting next token accuracy and identifying clinically pathogenic variants. We also show that our model outperforms existing models in a range of downstream tasks, including variant effect prediction and disease state identification. In fact, our largest sequence transformer for range adaptive nucleotide decoding variant (1B parameters) surpassed previous benchmarks, demonstrating a mean accuracy of 0.880 [an 8.2\% improvement over the original nucleotide transformer (NT) and a 7\% improvement over NT-v2]. Furthermore, we construct a unique exomic ClinVar dataset to evaluate the model’s performance on pathogenicity and disease states. Our results highlight the potential of this model to improve our understanding of the human exome and its role in disease. The model and its applications have significant implications for genomics-based diagnosis and personalized medicine, including tailored therapeutic development.},

	abstract = {Understanding the influence of both genetics and environment on human health, especially early in life, is essential for shaping long-term health. Here, we utilize a nationwide prospective birth cohort, the Japan Environment and Children’s Study (JECS), to conduct a large-scale population-based genetic study using biannual questionnaire surveys and biological and physical measurements collected from both parents and their children since the participant mothers were pregnant. Analyses of genome-wide genotyping for 80,639 child participants with parental consent and sufficient DNA from cord blood samples represent the genetic diversity of the general population in Japan. Systematic genome-wide association studies of 1,148 child health and developmental traits (including, e.g., food allergy, anthropometry measurements or ASQ-3 developmental screening) and parental environmental exposure traits (including, e.g., mercury or PFAS exposure) identify 5,685 common genomic loci (2,218 of which passed the phenome-wide significance threshold 𝑃 = 4.4 × 10−11), of which 15-17\% of loci represent novel associations not previously reported, including potential future therapeutic targets. Additional longitudinal GWAS of BMI, using Gaussian process regression, identified 153 novel dynamic genetic associations throughout child development. These associations can also be used to predict an individual’s growth trajectory based on their genetic background. In addition, genetic correlation analysis suggested some evidence that maternal environmental exposures during pregnancy influence child traits at birth. Together with studies of genetic risk factors and environmental exposures, across time and multiple outcomes, these demonstrate the uniqueness and value of the JECS data.},

	abstract = {Missense variants remain a challenge in genetic interpretation owing to their subtle and context-dependent effects. Although current prediction models perform well in known disease genes, their scores are not calibrated across the proteome, limiting generalizability. To address this knowledge gap, we developed popEVE, a deep generative model combining evolutionary and human population data to estimate variant deleteriousness on a proteome-wide scale. popEVE achieves state-of-the-art performance without overestimating the burden of deleterious variants and identifies variants in 442 genes in a severe developmental disorder cohort, including 123 novel candidates. These genes are functionally similar to known disease genes, and their variants often localize to critical regions. Remarkably, popEVE can prioritize likely causal variants using only child exomes, enabling diagnosis even without parental sequencing. This work provides a generalizable framework for rare disease variant interpretation, especially in singleton cases, and demonstrates the utility of calibrated, evolution-informed scoring models for clinical genomics.},

	abstract = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18\%-37\%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47\%-68\%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

	abstract = {Computational efforts to identify functional elements within genomes leverage comparative sequence information by looking for regions that exhibit evidence of selective constraint. One way of detecting constrained elements is to follow a bottom-up approach by computing constraint scores for individual positions of a multiple alignment and then defining constrained elements as segments of contiguous, highly scoring nucleotide positions. Here we present GERP++, a new tool that uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous bottom-up methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7\% of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence between predicted elements with known functional sequences. GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments.},

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS—the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases—make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},
