# State-of-the-Art in VEP – Missense, Multi-Modality, and Conservation

## AlphaMissense (Cheng et al., 2023)

- **Method**:
  - Represents the SOTA for missense VEP.
  - Leverages unsupervised protein language modeling.
  - Incorporates structural context derived from the AlphaFold system.
  - Fine-tuned on weak labels from population frequency data (avoiding human-curated annotation bias).
- **Coverage**:
  - Provides predictions for all possible single amino acid substitutions in the human proteome.
  - Confidently classifies:
    - 32% as likely pathogenic.
    - 57% as likely benign.

## Genomic Language Models Leveraging Evolution (GPN-MSA, Evo 2)

- **GPN-MSA**:
  - Integrates a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) across diverse vertebrate species into a Transformer architecture.
  - Evolutionary information enables it to outperform:
    - Traditional CADD.
    - Functional models like Enformer / SpliceAI in genome-wide deleteriousness prediction (coding and non-coding variants).
- **Evo 2**:
  - Genome-scale language model.
  - Strong zero-shot performance across various mutation types:
    - Coding, non-coding, non-SNV, splice-associated.
  - Set a new SOTA for BRCA1 non-coding SNVs.
  - Performed strongly on splice variant prediction using SpliceVarDB.

## AlphaGenome (Avsec et al., 2025)

- **Unification and Scale**:
  - Deep learning system designed to unify predictions across thousands of tracks:
    - Gene expression
    - Splicing
    - Chromatin accessibility
    - 3D contact maps
  - Uses a massive 1 Mb input sequence at base-pair resolution.
- **SOTA Performance**:
  - Matches or exceeds specialized external models on 24 out of 26 VEP evaluations.
  - Excels in multi-faceted splicing prediction:
    - Splice site probability
    - Usage
