It bridges the purely unsupervised PLM methods with structure-aware foundation models, showing how modest supervision from DMS data adds substantial value on top of pretrained representations.

(current discussion of EVE and ESM-1v is sparse!)

### Cross-Protein Transfer from Deep Mutational Scanning

A persistent challenge for variant effect predictors is the gap between functional assay measurements, which provide ground truth but cover only a handful of proteins, and clinical variant databases, which span the proteome but suffer from ascertainment bias and circularity concerns. Cross-protein transfer (CPT) models address this by training on deep mutational scanning data from a small number of proteins and evaluating generalization to unseen proteins across the human proteome [@jagota_cross-protein_2023].

The CPT-1 model combines features from multiple complementary sources: ESM-1v log-likelihood ratios capture deep evolutionary patterns learned from millions of protein sequences, vertebrate sequence alignments (using only approximately 100 genomes) provide constraint information at more recent evolutionary timescales, and AlphaFold2 structural features encode local geometric context around each residue. Training on DMS data from just five proteins with cell viability assays, CPT-1 learns weights that combine these features to predict pathogenicity.

The results demonstrate substantial improvements in the high-sensitivity regime most relevant for clinical applications. At 95% sensitivity for detecting pathogenic ClinVar variants, CPT-1 achieves 68% specificity compared to 55% for EVE and 27% for ESM-1v. This corresponds to thousands fewer false positives when screening candidate variants. Notably, the shallow vertebrate alignments contribute predictive signal beyond what the protein language model provides, suggesting that evolutionary constraint at different timescales captures distinct aspects of variant deleteriousness. The approach validates that functional measurements from a small number of well-characterized proteins can inform predictions across the proteome, providing a principled way to leverage growing MAVE datasets without the circularity concerns that affect methods trained directly on clinical annotations.

# Variant Effect Prediction  {#sec-veps}

## From Handcrafted Scores to Foundation Models

Variant effect prediction sits at the heart of modern genomics. Most variants discovered in clinical sequencing are rare and lack direct experimental evidence, yet clinicians still need to decide whether they are benign, pathogenic, or somewhere in between. Earlier in this book we encountered several approaches to this problem. Conservation and heuristic scores such as SIFT, PolyPhen, and CADD combine evolutionary constraint with manually engineered features to estimate deleteriousness (@sec-cadd) [@ng_sift_2003; @adzhubei_polyphen_2010; @rentzsch_cadd_2019]. Sequence-to-function CNNs like DeepSEA and ExPecto predict chromatin and expression effects that can serve as proxies for regulatory impact (@sec-reg; @sec-trans). Specialized architectures like SpliceAI target specific molecular mechanisms such as splicing disruption (@sec-splice). Protein language models trained on massive sequence databases learn representations that correlate with fitness and can be adapted for missense variant effect prediction (@sec-prot).

The frontier today is shaped by foundation models that combine massive pretraining at proteome or genome scale, long-range context spanning kilobases to megabases, and multiple sources of information including sequence, structure, multi-species alignments, and multi-omic outputs. These systems represent a qualitative shift from the feature engineering paradigm of earlier methods. Rather than defining relevant features a priori and training classifiers on those features, foundation models learn rich representations from data and then apply those representations to variant interpretation tasks.

This chapter surveys four landmark systems that define the current state of the art: AlphaMissense for proteome-wide missense pathogenicity prediction, GPN-MSA for genome-wide variant effect prediction from multi-species alignments, Evo 2 as a generalist genomic language model spanning all domains of life, and AlphaGenome as a unified megabase-scale sequence-to-function model with state-of-the-art regulatory variant effect prediction. Together, they preview what genomic foundation models look like when specialized for variant interpretation.


## AlphaMissense: Proteome-Wide Missense Pathogenicity

AlphaMissense, developed by DeepMind, provides precomputed pathogenicity scores for approximately 71 million possible human missense variants, covering almost every single amino acid change in the proteome [@cheng_alphamissense_2023]. This comprehensive scoring emerged from combining two powerful sources of information: the evolutionary constraints captured by protein language models and the structural context provided by AlphaFold2.

### Combining Sequence and Structure

The model builds on two complementary pillars. The first is protein language modeling, where a transformer-based model is trained on massive multiple sequence alignments to learn which amino acids tend to appear at each position across evolution. From this training, the model infers how surprising a given amino acid substitution is in its evolutionary context. Positions that are highly conserved across species receive confident predictions that alternative amino acids are deleterious, while positions that vary freely across evolution are predicted to tolerate substitutions.

The second pillar is predicted three-dimensional structure from AlphaFold2. Structural context helps distinguish tolerated changes from disruptive ones in ways that sequence alone cannot capture. A substitution on a solvent-exposed loop may be well tolerated even if the position is somewhat conserved, while a substitution in a tightly packed hydrophobic core may be disruptive even at a position with some evolutionary variability. The structural environment, including local secondary structure, packing density, and proximity to functional sites, provides crucial information about the consequences of amino acid changes.

For each variant, AlphaMissense ingests the wild-type sequence, the substitution position and amino acid change, sequence context from the MSA, and structural environment derived from AlphaFold2. These features are fed into a neural network that outputs a pathogenicity probability between 0 and 1.

### Training and Calibration

AlphaMissense employs a hybrid training strategy. Self-supervised pretraining learns general sequence and structural representations from evolutionary data, building on the foundational representations developed for AlphaFold2 and protein language modeling. Supervised calibration then uses ClinVar and similar databases for labeled pathogenic and benign variants, along with population frequency information from gnomAD under the assumption that common variants are more likely benign.

The model's raw scores are calibrated so that scores near 0 correspond to likely benign variants, scores near 1 correspond to likely pathogenic variants, and intermediate scores capture uncertainty and ambiguous cases. In practice, AlphaMissense adopts score cutoffs that approximately map to the "likely benign," "uncertain," and "likely pathogenic" categories used in clinical interpretation frameworks such as ACMG guidelines.

### Performance and Clinical Utility

Across diverse benchmarks including ClinVar, curated expert panels, and multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs), AlphaMissense achieves state-of-the-art AUROC and AUPRC for missense variant effect prediction. The model generalizes across many genes, including those with little prior annotation, and produces scores that correlate more consistently with experimental functional readouts than many earlier predictors.

These properties have led to rapid adoption. AlphaMissense scores have been integrated into clinical re-annotation of exomes, reclassification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and gene-specific studies where high-throughput functional assays are impractical. The precomputed nature of the predictions, covering essentially all possible missense variants, eliminates the need for users to run inference themselves.

### Limitations and Caveats

Despite its impressive performance, AlphaMissense has important limitations that users must understand. The model handles missense variants only and does not natively score nonsense, frameshift, regulatory, or deep intronic variants. It operates on single variants at a time, ignoring combinations of variants such as compound heterozygosity or epistatic interactions. The training depends on labels from ClinVar and population databases, meaning that any biases in those resources, including ancestry representation biases, can propagate into scores. Finally, while attention maps and feature attributions can be examined, the reasoning underlying a particular score is often opaque.

For these reasons, clinical guidelines recommend treating AlphaMissense as supporting evidence to be combined with segregation data, functional assays, and population frequencies rather than as a standalone decision-maker.


## GPN-MSA: Genome-Wide Variant Effect Prediction from Alignments

While AlphaMissense focuses on proteins, GPN-MSA tackles the harder problem of genome-wide variant effect prediction directly at the DNA level [@benegas_gpn-msa_2024]. This expansion is critical because most disease-associated variants discovered through GWAS and clinical sequencing fall in noncoding regions where protein-based methods provide no information.

### An Alignment-Based DNA Language Model

GPN-MSA extends earlier Genomic Pre-trained Network (GPN) models by operating on multi-species genome alignments. The input is a stack of aligned sequences from multiple species, for example human plus dozens of mammals. The model sees both the reference sequence and auxiliary features encoding how each aligned species matches, mismatches, or gaps at each base.

Training uses a masked language modeling objective analogous to BERT in natural language processing. The model randomly masks nucleotides in the reference sequence and predicts the masked base given the surrounding context and the aligned sequences. This objective encourages the model to learn evolutionary constraints: positions where substitutions are strongly disfavored across species receive confident predictions for the reference base, while unconstrained positions allow more flexibility.

### Variant Scoring Strategies

GPN-MSA supports several approaches to deriving variant effect scores. Likelihood-based scoring compares the model's log-likelihood or probability of the reference versus alternate allele at the variant position. Variants that substantially reduce the model's confidence in the sequence are inferred to be more disruptive. Embedding distance computes representations for reference and alternate sequences and uses their difference, for example Euclidean distance, as an effect magnitude. Influence scores quantify how much a variant perturbs the model's outputs across the surrounding genomic context.

Because the model operates on whole-genome alignments, it can score coding and noncoding variants, regulatory elements, introns, UTRs, and intergenic regions. It performs particularly well in regions with complex conservation patterns where simple phyloP-like scores struggle, capturing dependencies that go beyond position-by-position conservation.

### Benchmarking and Applications

GPN-MSA demonstrates strong performance on genome-wide pathogenic versus benign classification datasets, variant sets from genome-wide association studies, and functional readouts from high-throughput reporter assays. Its primary utility lies in genome-wide prefiltering, where it can prioritize candidate causal variants in regulatory regions, and in complementing protein-focused tools by supplying information in regions where AlphaMissense is blind.

The key limitation is dependency on high-quality multi-species alignments. Coverage and quality drop in repetitive regions, structurally complex regions, or poorly aligned segments of the genome. For variants in such regions, GPN-MSA predictions should be interpreted with caution or supplemented with other methods.


## Evo 2: A Generalist Genomic Language Model

Evo 2 pushes the foundation model paradigm to an extreme: it is a genome-scale language model trained across all domains of life, including bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes, and phages, on more than 9 trillion DNA tokens [@brixi_evo_2025]. Rather than specializing for any particular organism or task, Evo 2 aims to be a general-purpose genomic foundation model analogous to large language models in natural language processing.

### Scale and Architecture

Several features distinguish Evo 2 from earlier genomic models. The model uses autoregressive training on DNA, predicting the next base given the preceding context, analogous to next-token prediction in GPT-style text language models. The architecture is StripedHyena 2, which blends convolutional and attention mechanisms to support context windows up to 1 million base pairs while remaining computationally tractable. Multiple model sizes are available, including 7 billion and 40 billion parameter variants, with open-source weights, training code, and the OpenGenome2 dataset.

The cross-species training corpus is critical. By learning from genomes across the tree of life, Evo 2 captures evolutionary patterns that span far longer timescales than human-only or mammal-only models. This breadth comes at the cost of human-specific optimization, but the trade-off enables applications in non-model organisms and provides a distinctive view of sequence constraint.

### Zero-Shot Variant Effect Scoring

Remarkably, Evo 2 can be used for zero-shot variant interpretation without any supervised training on variant labels. For a given locus, one computes the model's sequence likelihood for the reference allele, then computes the likelihood for the alternate allele or the sequence containing it. The difference in likelihood provides a variant effect score, with variants that strongly reduce probability inferred to be more disruptive.

In benchmarks reported in the preprint and follow-up analyses, Evo 2 achieves competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy for pathogenic versus benign classification across multiple variant types, including both coding and noncoding, even without variant-specific supervised training. When a simple supervised classifier is built on Evo 2 embeddings, it reaches state-of-the-art performance on tasks like BRCA1 VUS classification.

### Cross-Species Variant Interpretation

Because Evo 2 is trained across diverse species, it naturally supports variant effect prediction in non-model organisms such as livestock and crops. It can help quantify mutation load, prioritize variants for breeding programs, and guide genome editing designs across species. However, its generality comes with trade-offs. Domain-specific models like AlphaMissense for human missense or AlphaGenome for regulatory variants may still outperform Evo 2 on certain human-centric tasks, and careful calibration and benchmarking are required before any clinical application.


## AlphaGenome: Unified Megabase-Scale Regulatory Modeling

Where Evo 2 is generalist and sequence-only, AlphaGenome is explicitly designed as a multimodal regulatory model of the human genome, with a focus on variant effect prediction across many functional readouts [@avsec_alphagenome_2025]. It represents the current frontier in regulatory variant effect prediction.

### Architecture: Convolutions and Transformers over 1 Megabase

AlphaGenome takes as input 1 megabase of DNA sequence and produces predictions at single-base resolution for a large set of genomic tracks. These tracks include chromatin accessibility and histone marks, transcription factor binding, gene expression measured by CAGE-like signals, three-dimensional genome contacts, and splicing features including junctions and splice site usage.

The architecture combines complementary components. Convolutional layers detect local sequence motifs, analogous to the early layers of DeepSEA and its successors. Transformer blocks propagate information across the full megabase context, capturing the long-range dependencies that CNNs struggle to model. Task-specific heads output different experimental modalities across many tissues and cell types. This design generalizes earlier models like Basenji, Enformer (for regulatory tracks), and SpliceAI (for splicing) into a single unified model (@sec-hybrid; @sec-splice).

### Variant Effect Prediction Across Modalities

Given a reference sequence and a candidate variant, AlphaGenome scores variant effects by predicting genome-wide functional tracks for the reference sequence, predicting the same tracks for the sequence bearing the variant, and comparing predictions to obtain delta signals across regulatory elements, splicing patterns, gene expression levels, and three-dimensional contact maps affecting enhancer-promoter communication.

On extensive benchmarks, AlphaGenome achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting unseen functional genomics tracks and shows strong performance on diverse variant effect tasks including noncoding disease variants, splicing disruptions, and regulatory MPRA data. Critically, it provides mechanistic hypotheses about which tracks and tissues are disrupted rather than only a single scalar risk score. An API makes AlphaGenome accessible to the research community, enabling large-scale variant scoring without local training infrastructure.


## Comparing Design Choices Across Modern VEP Models

The models surveyed in this chapter span different points in a multidimensional design space. Understanding these differences helps practitioners choose appropriate tools for their applications.

| Model | Input Modality | Context Length | Pretraining Data | Variant Types | Primary Outputs |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| AlphaMissense | Protein sequence + structure | Protein-length | MSAs + structural environment | Missense only | Pathogenicity probability |
| GPN-MSA | Multi-species DNA alignments | kb-scale windows | Whole-genome MSAs (multiple species) | Coding + noncoding | Likelihood / embedding-based scores |
| Evo 2 | Raw DNA sequence | Up to ~1 Mb | OpenGenome2 (all domains of life) | All variant types | Zero-shot likelihood-based scores |
| AlphaGenome | Raw DNA sequence | 1 Mb | Human genome + multi-omic tracks | All variant types | Multi-omic tracks + delta effects |

Several key contrasts emerge from this comparison. In terms of scope, AlphaMissense is human-missense-specific with deep clinical calibration, GPN-MSA and AlphaGenome are human-genome-centric and span coding and regulatory variants, while Evo 2 is cross-species and general-purpose. For context and long-range effects, AlphaMissense operates at protein scale, GPN-MSA uses modest windows centered on the variant, and Evo 2 and AlphaGenome support megabase-scale context capable of capturing long-range regulatory interactions. Regarding outputs, AlphaMissense and GPN-MSA primarily produce scalar scores, Evo 2 outputs likelihoods and embeddings that require task-specific postprocessing, and AlphaGenome outputs rich functional profiles that enable mechanistic hypotheses about variant effects.

### Specialized vs. General Regulatory Models

A recurring tension in regulatory variant effect prediction concerns the tradeoff between specialized tissue-specific models and general pan-tissue approaches. Models like Enformer and Sei learn regulatory patterns across hundreds of cell types and assays, achieving broad applicability at the cost of potentially diluting tissue-specific signals. Specialized models take the opposite approach, concentrating capacity on a single biological context.

TREDNet illustrates the specialized strategy, training exclusively on pancreatic islet enhancer data to predict regulatory effects of variants at T2D-associated loci [@hudaiberdiev_trednet_2023]. Recent benchmarking suggests that such CNN-based tissue-specific models can outperform both general-purpose CNNs and transformer architectures when evaluated on variants in their target tissue context, though hybrid CNN-transformer models like Borzoi show advantages for fine-mapping tasks requiring discrimination among variants in linkage disequilibrium [@manzo_comparative_2025]. The practical implication is that model selection should consider the biological question: foundation models provide broad coverage suitable for exploratory analyses, while specialized models may be preferable when the tissue and disease context are well-defined.

## Practical Use: Choosing and Interpreting Modern VEP Tools

In realistic workflows, these models are complementary rather than competing. The choice of tool depends on the variant type, the available resources, and the downstream application.

### Coding Missense Variants

For human missense variants, AlphaMissense provides a high-coverage, clinically calibrated score that serves as an excellent starting point. This should be complemented with protein language model embeddings from ESM or related systems for gene-specific or domain-specific modeling (@sec-prot), conservation and population data including GPN-MSA scores in coding regions and gnomAD frequencies, and gene-level context such as constraint metrics and disease association history.

### Noncoding and Regulatory Variants

For regulatory variation in promoters, enhancers, introns, and intergenic regions, AlphaGenome is currently the most comprehensive option. It provides tissue-specific changes in chromatin and expression, splicing consequences for intronic and exonic variants, and potential disruption of long-range enhancer-promoter interactions. GPN-MSA serves as a valuable complement when a conservation-grounded score is desired, when high-quality multi-species alignments are available, or when scanning broad regions genome-wide without requiring the full multi-omic output that AlphaGenome provides.

### Cross-Species and Large-Scale Modeling

For non-human organisms or when building general-purpose genomic tools, Evo 2 is the natural choice. Its zero-shot variant scoring works in poorly annotated species, it can guide the design and screening of genome edits, and it can serve as a feature extractor feeding downstream supervised models trained on organism-specific labels.

### Score Interpretation and Calibration

Regardless of the model, variant effect scores should be treated as probabilistic evidence rather than binary labels. Calibration is essential: does a score of 0.9 truly correspond to approximately 90% pathogenic variants, or is the score distribution shifted? The distribution of scores within a gene matters, since outliers relative to the gene's typical score distribution are more suspect. Consistency across tools strengthens confidence, and agreement between AlphaMissense, GPN-MSA, AlphaGenome, Evo 2, and simpler conservation metrics provides more reliable evidence than any single score.

Where possible, predictions should be tied back to mechanistic hypotheses such as splice site disruption or enhancer-promoter rewiring, and experimental follow-up through targeted assays, MPRA, or CRISPR screens should be considered for variants of high clinical interest.


## Open Challenges and Future Directions

Even these state-of-the-art systems leave major gaps that define the frontier of variant effect prediction research.

### Ancestry and Population Bias

Training data and labels remain skewed toward certain ancestries, raising concerns about performance and calibration in underrepresented populations. ClinVar submissions are predominantly from European-ancestry individuals, and population frequency databases like gnomAD have similar biases. Models trained on these data may systematically misclassify variants that are common in non-European populations but rare in training data. Addressing this bias requires both more diverse data collection and explicit modeling of population structure in variant effect prediction frameworks.

### Complex Variant Patterns

Most models focus on single-base or single-amino-acid changes. Systematic handling of haplotypes, where multiple variants on the same chromosome may interact; indels and structural variants, which can have complex functional consequences; and epistatic interactions across distant loci remains in its infancy. The combinatorial explosion of possible multi-variant genotypes makes exhaustive scoring impractical, and the training data for multi-variant effects is sparse.

### Integrating Multi-Omics and Longitudinal Data

AlphaGenome marks a step toward unified multi-omic prediction, but dynamic phenomena including developmental trajectories, environmental responses, and time-series measurements are only lightly modeled. The static nature of current variant effect predictions misses the reality that variant effects can be highly context-dependent, varying across cell types, developmental stages, and environmental conditions.

### Interpretability and Clinical Communication

Translating high-dimensional predictions into explanations that clinicians and patients can understand, and that map onto emerging guidelines for AI-assisted variant interpretation, remains a human-factor challenge. A score alone, no matter how accurate, is often insufficient for clinical decision-making. Clinicians need to understand why a variant is predicted to be pathogenic, which aspects of the prediction are most certain, and how the prediction relates to the specific clinical question at hand.

### Safe Deployment and Continual Learning

As more functional datasets and clinical labels accumulate, models will need continual updating without catastrophic forgetting, along with governance frameworks to track model versions and provenance. The rapid pace of model development creates challenges for clinical integration, where stability and reproducibility are paramount.

In subsequent chapters, we will connect these VEP systems to broader issues in evaluation (@sec-eval), confounding and bias (@sec-confound), and interpretability (@sec-interp), positioning them within the broader landscape of genomic foundation models. The models described here illustrate how the building blocks from earlier chapters, including NGS data, functional genomics, CNNs, transformers, and protein and DNA language models, coalesce into powerful end-to-end systems for variant interpretation.
