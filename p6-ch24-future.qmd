# Future Work & Ethics {#sec-future}

## Introduction
Brief framing: GFMs as a rapidly evolving field; chapter synthesizes open questions raised throughout the book and looks forward.

## Technical Frontiers

### Unified Multi-omic Foundation Models
- Current fragmentation: DNA-only, protein-only, single-cell, etc.
- Vision: joint models spanning DNA → RNA → protein → phenotype
- Cross-modal queries and interpretable causal chains
- Early work (Omni-DNA, G2PT) and remaining gaps

### Long-Context and Whole-Genome Modeling
- Context length limitations (512k vs. 3B bp genome)
- Chromosome-scale and 3D genome structure integration
- Efficient architectures: linear attention, state-space models, sparse attention

### Generative and Design-Oriented Models
- From prediction to generation: synthetic regulatory elements, protein design
- Controllable generation and safety considerations
- Laboratory validation loops

### Causal and Mechanistic Integration
- Moving beyond correlation: causal representation learning
- Incorporating gene regulatory network priors
- Counterfactual reasoning for perturbation prediction

## Deployment & Translation Considerations

### Prospective Validation and Regulatory Pathways
- Gap between benchmark performance and clinical utility
- FDA/CE-IVD pathways for genomic AI
- Post-market surveillance and model updates

### Infrastructure and Accessibility
- Compute requirements vs. research lab realities
- Distillation, quantization, edge deployment
- Build-vs-buy decisions for health systems

### Interoperability and Standards
- Variant representation (VCF, HGVS, SPDI)
- Model card standards and documentation requirements
- Reproducibility and versioning challenges

---

## Ethical Dimensions

### Equity and Representation
- Ancestry bias in training data and performance disparities
- Strategies: diverse pretraining corpora, ancestry-stratified evaluation, recalibration
- Who benefits from GFMs? Global health considerations

### Privacy, Consent, and Data Governance
- Genomic data sensitivity and re-identification risk
- Consent models for large-scale pretraining
- Federated learning and synthetic data as potential solutions

### Dual Use and Biosecurity
- Potential misuse: pathogen enhancement, privacy attacks
- Responsible disclosure practices
- Community governance models

### Transparency and Accountability
- Black-box concerns in clinical decision support
- Right to explanation in healthcare contexts
- Liability and responsibility when models err

---

## The Shifting Research Landscape

### Benchmark Culture and Incentives
- Overfitting to narrow benchmarks
- Moving toward clinically meaningful endpoints
- Value of negative results and failure mode documentation

### Open Science vs. Industrial Scale
- Tension between reproducibility and compute requirements
- Role of academic labs in GFM development
- Data and model sharing norms

## Conclusion
- Synthesis of key uncertainties
- Framework for evaluating future developments
- Call for interdisciplinary engagement (genomics, ML, ethics, policy)
