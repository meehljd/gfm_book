## Biological Graph Types
### Protein-Protein Interaction Networks
- STRING, BioGRID, and curated interaction databases
- Physical vs. functional interactions
- Network topology and hub genes

Traditional approaches to protein-protein interaction prediction rely on sequence features, domain annotations, or curated databases, but these methods often fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in interaction networks. A protein exists both as an individual molecular entity with internal structure and as a node in the larger interactome.

HIGH-PPI addresses this scale mismatch through a double-viewed hierarchical graph learning model [@gao_high-ppi_2023]. The architecture constructs a hierarchical graph where each node in the PPI network (representing a protein at the outside-of-protein view) is itself a graph (representing the protein's structure at the inside-of-protein view). At the bottom level, chemically relevant descriptors rather than raw sequences capture the structure-function relationship of each protein, enabling better generalization to novel proteins or interaction contexts.

This hierarchical design offers several advantages for interaction prediction. At the outside-of-protein level, the model learns network topology features that capture functional context (proteins interacting with similar partners may have related functions). At the inside-of-protein level, the model learns structural features relevant to binding interfaces. The attention mechanisms that connect these levels can identify which internal structural features matter for which network-level relationships, providing interpretability that standard sequence-based predictors lack.

Beyond binary interaction prediction, HIGH-PPI demonstrates capacity for mechanistic interpretation by identifying binding and catalytic sites that drive specific interactions. This interpretability addresses a persistent criticism of deep learning for interaction prediction: that models learn to exploit dataset biases rather than genuine binding determinants. The hierarchical attention provides evidence for which structural features contribute to each prediction.

### Gene Regulatory Networks
- Transcription factor-target relationships
- Chromatin accessibility and enhancer-gene links
- Inferred vs. experimentally validated edges

### Pathway and Ontology Graphs
- KEGG, Reactome, GO hierarchies
- Pathway membership as prior knowledge
- Gene-pathway bipartite graphs

### Knowledge Graphs in Biomedicine
- Drug-gene-disease relationships
- Heterogeneous biomedical graphs
- Link prediction and knowledge completion

Knowledge graphs provide a powerful abstraction for biomedical data that naturally captures the heterogeneous relationships between genes, diseases, drugs, and biological processes. Unlike homogeneous graphs where all edges represent the same relationship type, knowledge graphs encode multiple relationship types within a single structure, enabling richer reasoning about indirect connections and multi-hop paths.

PrimeKG exemplifies modern biomedical knowledge graph construction at scale [@chandak_primekg_2023]. The resource integrates 20 high-quality databases to describe over 17,000 diseases through more than 4 million relationships spanning ten biological scales, from disease-associated protein perturbations through biological processes and pathways to anatomical and phenotypic levels. Critically, PrimeKG includes the full range of approved drugs with their therapeutic actions, providing comprehensive coverage of drug-disease relationships including indications, contraindications, and off-label uses that remain sparse in other knowledge graphs.

What distinguishes PrimeKG from earlier efforts is its multimodal design philosophy. Beyond the graph structure itself, PrimeKG supplements edges with natural language descriptions of clinical guidelines, enabling multimodal analyses that combine graph-based reasoning with language model approaches. This design anticipates the convergence of graph neural networks and language models that characterizes modern foundation model architectures.

Graph neural networks operating on PrimeKG and similar knowledge graphs can propagate information across relationship types, allowing known disease associations to inform prioritization of novel candidate genes. A typical workflow constructs a multi-relational graph with genes as nodes and edges representing protein interactions, pathway co-membership, regulatory relationships, and phenotype associations. Node features can be initialized using foundation model outputs: aggregated variant effect scores, expression embeddings, and constraint metrics. The GNN then learns to combine local node features with propagated neighborhood information to predict labels such as disease association, drug target potential, or therapeutic indication.
