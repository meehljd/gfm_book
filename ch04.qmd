# DeepSEA and Ab Initio Regulatory Prediction

## The DeepSEA Methodology (Zhou & Troyanskaya, 2015)

- Introduced the fundamental application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the functional effects of non-coding variants directly from sequence input.

## Training Scale

- Trained to predict a large number of chromatin profiles (e.g., 919 tracks).

## Significance

- Established the viability of using CNNs to implicitly learn the underlying regulatory code or “syntax” of the genome by recognizing local sequence patterns and motifs.
