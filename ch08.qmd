# Integrating Long-Range Interactions for Expression Prediction

## Enformer (Avsec et al., 2021)

- **Architecture**:
  - Hybrid CNN–Transformer model.
  - Extends receptive field up to 100 kb (vs. 20 kb for predecessors like ExPecto).
  - Uses attention layers to refine predictions by gathering information from distal elements like enhancers.
- **Clinical Relevance**:
  - Larger context size is crucial because distal elements drive tissue-specific gene expression.
  - Significantly improved accuracy of non-coding Variant Effect Prediction (VEP) on eQTL data.
  - Enables signed prediction of mutation effects (activating vs. repressive).

## Borzoi (Linder et al., 2025)

- **Unifying Regulatory Layers**:
  - Based on the Enformer architecture.
  - Trained to predict cell-type–specific and tissue-specific RNA-seq coverage directly from DNA sequence.
- **Multilayer Scoring**:
  - By predicting coverage, Borzoi allows variant effects to be scored across multiple regulatory layers:
    - Transcription
    - Splicing
    - Polyadenylation
  - Often outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models trained on individual functions.
  - Borzoi-derived variant scores, combined with CADD scores, show equal power in discriminating between common benign variants and rare singletons in regulatory elements.
