## Understanding Book Marketing

### The Marketing Funnel for Textbooks

1. **Awareness**: Target reader learns book exists
2. **Interest**: Reader sees it addresses their need
3. **Consideration**: Reader compares to alternatives
4. **Decision**: Reader (or institution) purchases
5. **Adoption**: Reader recommends/assigns to others

Each piece of marketing copy serves different funnel stages.
