# Polygenic Risk Scores and GWAS Foundations

## The GWAS Paradigm

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. By testing millions of common genetic variants across large populations, GWAS identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) statistically associated with phenotypes of interest. The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog now contains tens of thousands of robust associations across hundreds of traits.

### Key Concepts

**Effect sizes and summary statistics**: For each tested variant, GWAS produces summary statistics including:

- Effect size (β): The estimated change in phenotype per copy of the effect allele
- Standard error: Uncertainty in the effect estimate
- P-value: Statistical significance of the association
- Allele frequency: Population prevalence of the variant

Most GWAS-identified variants have small individual effects—typically explaining less than 1% of phenotypic variance each—reflecting the highly polygenic nature of complex traits.

**Linkage disequilibrium (LD)**: Variants that are physically close on a chromosome tend to be inherited together, creating correlations in genotype data. This LD structure means that GWAS signals often implicate blocks of correlated variants rather than pinpointing causal variants directly. LD patterns vary substantially across populations due to different demographic histories, creating challenges for cross-ancestry analyses.

## The Fine-Mapping Challenge

A central challenge in post-GWAS analysis is distinguishing causal variants from those merely correlated with causal variants through LD. Fine-mapping methods attempt to resolve this by computing posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) for each variant being causal.

Statistical fine-mapping approaches like SuSiE identify credible sets of variants likely to contain the causal variant [@avsec_enformer_2021]. For 48 well-powered traits in the UK Biobank, genome-wide fine-mapping identified causal variants collectively explaining 17% of SNP-based heritability, though reaching 50% would require approximately 2 million samples on average [@wu_genome-wide_2024].

The majority of GWAS-identified variants are spuriously correlated with the phenotype through LD rather than being truly causal. Fine-mapping—predicting which variants are causal—is crucial for downstream tasks including uncovering biological mechanisms and constructing robust polygenic risk scores [@rakowski_mifm_2025].

## Constructing Polygenic Risk Scores

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) aggregate the effects of many genetic variants into a single measure of an individual's genetic predisposition to a trait or disease.

### Traditional PRS Methods

**Clumping and thresholding (C+T)**: The simplest approach:

1. Select variants below a p-value threshold
2. "Clump" correlated variants, keeping only the most significant per LD block
3. Sum effect sizes weighted by genotype dosage

**LDpred and Bayesian methods**: More sophisticated approaches model the joint distribution of effect sizes while accounting for LD structure, typically improving prediction accuracy over C+T methods.

**Linear assumptions**: Most PRS methods assume that variant effects:

- Scale linearly with allele count (additive model)
- Are constant across individuals
- Combine additively across the genome

While computationally convenient, these assumptions increase error, particularly for individuals from underrepresented populations [@georgantas_delphi_2024].

## Heritability and Its Partitioning

**SNP-based heritability** ($h^2_{SNP}$) estimates the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by all measured common variants. This is typically lower than family-based heritability estimates, a phenomenon termed "missing heritability."

**LD Score Regression (LDSR)** enables partitioning of heritability using only GWAS summary statistics. By correlating test statistics with LD scores, LDSR can estimate:

- Total SNP heritability
- Heritability enrichment in functional annotations
- Genetic correlations between traits

Analysis of UK Biobank GWAS revealed that heritability partitions distinctly across regulatory sequence classes, with tissue-specific enhancers explaining substantial heritability for relevant traits—for example, monocyte/macrophage enhancers for monocyte count, and brain enhancers for cognitive traits [@zhou_sei_2022].

## Limitations of Current Approaches

### Ancestry Bias

The vast majority of GWAS have been conducted in populations of European ancestry. This creates systematic problems:

- **Reduced prediction accuracy**: PRS derived from European GWAS perform substantially worse in non-European populations due to differences in LD structure and allele frequencies
- **Health disparities**: Clinical deployment of ancestry-biased PRS could exacerbate existing health inequities
- **Missed variants**: Causal variants common in non-European populations but rare in Europeans may be missed entirely

### Missing Heritability

SNP-based heritability estimates typically capture only 20-50% of family-based heritability, attributed to:

- **Rare variants**: GWAS are underpowered to detect rare variant associations
- **Structural variants**: Most arrays and imputation panels miss copy number variants and other structural variation
- **Gene-gene interactions (epistasis)**: Standard additive models ignore non-linear interactions
- **Gene-environment interactions**: Effects that depend on environmental context

### Mechanistic Opacity

GWAS associations rarely identify causal genes or mechanisms directly:

- Most significant variants lie in non-coding regions
- The nearest gene is often not the causal gene
- Regulatory effects may act over large genomic distances

## The Promise of Deep Learning

These limitations motivate the deep learning approaches covered in subsequent chapters. Sequence-based models can:

1. **Predict variant effects *ab initio***: Models like ExPecto and Enformer predict functional consequences from sequence alone, enabling prioritization of likely causal variants within LD blocks [@zhou_expecto_2018; @avsec_enformer_2021]

2. **Improve fine-mapping**: Functional predictions can be integrated with statistical fine-mapping to improve causal variant identification. Hybrid CNN-transformer models like Borzoi show superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within LD blocks [@manzo_comparative_2025]

3. **Enable cross-ancestry transfer**: By learning functional effects from sequence rather than population-specific LD patterns, sequence models may generalize better across ancestries. Variants prioritized by sequence-based models construct PRS that transfer better to non-European target populations [@rakowski_mifm_2025]

4. **Capture non-linear effects**: Deep learning architectures can model complex, non-linear relationships between genotype and phenotype. Methods like Delphi relax linear assumptions to produce more predictive PRS, with relative improvements of 11-35% in variance explained across traits [@georgantas_delphi_2024]

5. **Incorporate rare variants**: Approaches like DeepRVAT learn gene impairment scores from rare variant annotations, facilitating refinement of PRS by accounting for rare variant effects that standard GWAS miss.

The chapters that follow trace the development of these capabilities, from early CNN-based regulatory prediction through modern transformer architectures that integrate long-range genomic context.
