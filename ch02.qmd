# Establishing Genome-Wide Deleteriousness Scores

## The Need for Universal Scoring

- Genetic variant interpretation, crucial for personalized medicine, requires estimating the functional impact of variations throughout the human genome.

## Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD)

- **Principle**:
  - CADD is a machine-learning–based scoring system (logistic regression model).
  - Integrates hundreds of genomic annotations to assign a single deleteriousness score to SNVs and short InDels.
- **Training Objective**:
  - Learns to contrast a set of “proxy-neutral” variants (those observed in humans, assumed harmless) against a set of “proxy-deleterious” variants (simulated variants that have not been filtered by selection).
- **Evolution (CADD v1.7)**:
  - Recent iterations integrate features derived from advanced models, including:
    - Protein language model scores (Meta ESM-1v).
    - Regulatory variant effect predictions from sequence-based CNNs.
  - Demonstrates the flexible and modular nature of the CADD framework.
