# Part VI: Clinical Translation {#sec-part6-intro}

The question shifts from how these models work to how they are used, and from what they can predict to what they enable us to do. This transition is not merely practical but conceptual: deploying a model in a clinical or industrial setting exposes assumptions that benchmarks leave implicit and reveals failure modes that curated evaluations obscure. A model achieving impressive metrics on held-out test sets may falter when deployed on populations underrepresented in training data, when integrated into workflows designed around different assumptions, or when its outputs must be communicated to clinicians and patients who lack the technical background to interpret confidence intervals. The gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility represents one of the most consequential challenges in genomic AI.

Deployment transforms the requirements for genomic foundation models. Clinical risk prediction, rare disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and biological design each impose constraints absent from research settings: calibration requirements become stricter, fairness considerations become urgent, interpretability demands become concrete, and the consequences of failure become measured in patient outcomes rather than leaderboard rankings.

Clinical risk prediction (@sec-ch25-clinical-risk) combines foundation model features with electronic health records to stratify patients for disease, progression, and treatment response. Variant interpretation in rare disease (@sec-ch26-rare-disease) enters diagnostic pipelines alongside clinical geneticists and laboratory scientists. Drug discovery applications (@sec-ch27-drug-discovery) contribute to target identification, genetic validation, and biomarker development. Reversing the direction of inference from prediction to generation (@sec-ch28-design), foundation models guide protein engineering, regulatory element design, and programmable biology. Regulatory, ethical, and frontier challenges (@sec-ch29-future) will shape how genomic AI moves from research to practice. The goal is not definitive protocols for each domain but a framework for reasoning about deployment: what questions to ask, what pitfalls to anticipate, and what principles should guide responsible development.
