# 3D Genome Organization {#sec-3d-genome}

The human genome spans approximately two meters of linear DNA, yet it must fit within a nucleus roughly ten micrometers in diameter: a compaction ratio of nearly 200,000 to one. This folding is not random. Specific sequences contact each other across vast genomic distances while others remain isolated, and these contact patterns determine which enhancers can activate which genes. An enhancer 500 kilobases from its target can drive transcription only because intervening chromatin folds to bring them into physical proximity. The regulatory models predict expression from sequence within a fixed window, treating the genome as a one-dimensional string. They cannot explain why an enhancer activates one gene and not another when multiple promoters lie within range.

Disruptions to 3D genome architecture cause disease through mechanisms that sequence alone cannot predict. When structural variants delete a boundary between chromatin domains, enhancers can contact genes they normally never reach, a phenomenon called enhancer hijacking that underlies developmental disorders and cancer. The clinical consequences depend entirely on which contacts are disrupted. A deletion that removes a domain boundary may be pathogenic; an identical-sized deletion preserving boundaries may be benign. Current variant effect prediction tools largely ignore this spatial dimension, creating systematic blind spots for structural variant interpretation.

This chapter examines how the genome folds, what determines that folding, and how computational models predict 3D structure from sequence. We begin with the hierarchy of chromatin organization, from megabase-scale compartments through topologically associating domains to kilobase-scale loops. We introduce the experimental methods (Hi-C, Micro-C, imaging approaches) that measure these structures. The technical core covers models that predict chromatin contacts from sequence, including Akita, Orca, and C.Origami, examining what architectural features they learn and where prediction fails. We extend to spatial transcriptomics, where tissue architecture provides cellular context for gene expression, and connect throughout to regulatory models: what does spatial context add that sequence alone cannot provide?


## Chromatin Organization Hierarchy {#sec-chromatin-hierarchy}

The genome folds through multiple organizational levels, each with distinct functional consequences and arising from different molecular mechanisms. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for interpreting both normal gene regulation and how structural variants cause disease. The levels are not independent; they interact in complex ways that computational models must capture to predict 3D structure accurately.

At the largest scale, chromosomes occupy distinct nuclear volumes called chromosome territories. Gene-rich chromosomes tend toward the nuclear interior while gene-poor chromosomes associate with the nuclear periphery. This territorial organization limits which chromosomes can exchange material during translocations: recurrent cancer-associated translocations occur preferentially between chromosomes that occupy neighboring territories. While chromosome territory organization has clear functional implications, most computational models focus on finer-scale structures where sequence determinants are more tractable.

Within chromosome territories, chromatin partitions into two major compartment types distinguished by their transcriptional activity and chromatin state. A compartments contain gene-rich, transcriptionally active chromatin with open, accessible structure. B compartments contain gene-poor, transcriptionally silent regions often associated with the nuclear lamina at the nuclear periphery. This compartmentalization is visible in Hi-C contact maps as a characteristic checkerboard pattern: A compartment regions preferentially contact other A regions even when separated by megabases, while B regions contact other B regions. Compartment identity correlates strongly with histone modifications (H3K27ac marks active A compartments; H3K9me3 marks repressive B compartments) and changes during cellular differentiation as lineage-specific genes shift between active and inactive states. The molecular mechanism underlying compartmentalization appears to involve phase separation: regions with similar chromatin states aggregate through weak multivalent interactions, creating nuclear microenvironments with distinct biochemical properties.

Below the megabase scale of compartments, the genome organizes into topologically associating domains, or TADs: sub-megabase regions (median approximately 800 kilobases in mammals) within which sequences contact each other more frequently than with sequences outside the domain. TAD boundaries appear as sharp transitions in contact frequency, visible in Hi-C maps as triangular domains along the matrix diagonal. These boundaries show remarkable conservation across mammalian species and across cell types within a species, suggesting strong selective pressure to maintain domain organization. The prevailing model holds that TADs constrain enhancer-promoter interactions: regulatory elements within a TAD can contact genes in the same domain, but boundaries prevent crosstalk with genes in adjacent domains. This insulation function has clear clinical relevance. Deletions that remove TAD boundaries allow enhancers to contact genes they normally cannot reach. In a well-characterized example, deletions removing the boundary between the *EPHA4* locus and the *WNT6/PAX3* region allow limb enhancers to ectopically activate *WNT6*, causing brachydactyly and other limb malformations [@lupiañez_disruptions_2015].

The molecular basis of TAD formation is now well understood through the loop extrusion model. The cohesin protein complex loads onto chromatin and extrudes DNA bidirectionally, progressively enlarging the extruded loop until it encounters an obstacle. The key obstacle is CTCF protein bound to DNA in a specific orientation. When cohesin encounters CTCF sites oriented toward each other (convergent orientation), extrusion halts and a stable loop forms with the convergent CTCF sites at the loop anchors. This model explains several key observations: TAD boundaries are enriched for CTCF binding sites; CTCF motif orientation predicts which sites will anchor loops (convergent pairs form loops while divergent pairs do not); and acute degradation of cohesin eliminates TADs within hours while leaving compartments intact. The distinction between compartment and TAD formation mechanisms has important implications for prediction. Models that capture CTCF binding and orientation can predict TAD boundaries; predicting compartments requires learning different sequence features associated with chromatin state.

At the finest scale, chromatin forms specific loops between defined loci. Enhancer-promoter loops bring distal regulatory elements into physical proximity with their target genes, while structural loops between convergent CTCF sites establish the TAD framework. Most enhancer-promoter contacts span less than 200 kilobases, but some extend over a megabase. Detecting these fine-scale contacts requires high-resolution data; the Micro-C method uses micrococcal nuclease digestion to achieve nucleosome-level resolution, revealing contact patterns invisible in standard Hi-C. The functional significance of individual loops remains debated. Some loops appear essential for gene activation; others may be structural features without direct regulatory consequences.


## Measuring the 3D Genome {#sec-3d-measurement}

Predicting 3D genome structure requires training data: measurements of which sequences contact which other sequences in real cells. Chromosome conformation capture methods provide these measurements through a common biochemical principle. Cells are crosslinked with formaldehyde to freeze chromatin contacts in place; DNA is digested with restriction enzymes; free DNA ends are ligated, preferentially joining fragments that were spatially proximate; and the ligated junctions are identified through sequencing. The frequency of junction reads between two genomic regions reflects how often those regions were in physical contact across the cell population.

Hi-C extends this principle genome-wide by incorporating biotinylated nucleotides at ligation junctions, enabling purification of chimeric fragments from the entire genome. The output is a contact matrix where rows and columns represent genomic bins (typically 1 to 50 kilobases depending on sequencing depth) and values represent contact frequencies between bin pairs. Resolution depends directly on sequencing depth: achieving 1 kilobase resolution requires billions of reads, while 10 kilobase resolution requires hundreds of millions. Raw contact frequencies require extensive normalization to correct for biases from GC content, restriction site density, and mappability. The ICE (iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition) method and related approaches remove these technical artifacts while preserving biological signal.

The contact matrix encodes all levels of chromatin organization. Compartments appear as the checkerboard pattern when viewing megabase-scale interactions; TADs appear as triangular domains of enriched contacts along the diagonal; and loops appear as focal enrichments at specific off-diagonal positions. The matrix is dominated by the polymer effect: sequences that are close in linear distance contact each other frequently regardless of specific 3D structure, creating strong signal along the diagonal that can obscure biologically meaningful contacts at greater distances.

Beyond standard Hi-C, several technologies address specific limitations. Micro-C achieves nucleosome-level resolution by using micrococcal nuclease instead of restriction enzymes, revealing fine-scale contact patterns invisible at standard Hi-C resolution. Single-cell Hi-C measures contacts in individual cells, revealing that any two loci contact each other in only 5 to 15 percent of cells, but the resulting matrices are extremely sparse (most possible contacts are unmeasured in any single cell). Imaging methods such as DNA FISH directly visualize genomic loci in the nucleus, providing ground truth for computational predictions but at much lower throughput than sequencing-based approaches.

Training data for 3D prediction models comes primarily from a small number of well-characterized cell lines. The lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878 and the leukemia cell line K562 have deep Hi-C coverage across multiple laboratories, making them the default training sets for most models. Primary tissues and rare cell types have sparse coverage, creating a significant gap between where models are trained and where clinical applications require predictions. The 4D Nucleome Data Portal and ENCODE provide the most comprehensive repositories of 3D genome data, though coverage remains heavily biased toward common cell lines and human samples.


## Predicting 3D Structure from Sequence {#sec-3d-prediction}

If 3D genome structure determines which enhancers contact which genes, can we predict that structure directly from DNA sequence? Success here would enable predicting how mutations affect chromatin folding even when no Hi-C data exists for the relevant cell type or genetic variant. The core prediction task takes DNA sequence surrounding a genomic region (typically 1 to 2 megabases) as input and produces a predicted contact matrix at some resolution (typically 2 to 10 kilobase bins) as output. The training signal comes from experimentally measured Hi-C contact frequencies, with models learning to map sequence features to the patterns of contacts observed in real data.

**Akita** established the foundational approach for sequence-based 3D prediction [@fudenberg_predicting_2020]. The architecture uses dilated convolutions similar to SpliceAI (@sec-cnn), processing the one-dimensional input sequence through convolutional layers that progressively expand the receptive field to approximately one megabase. A symmetric output layer transforms the processed sequence into a two-dimensional contact matrix. Training uses mean squared error loss on log-transformed, distance-normalized contact frequencies, where distance normalization removes the strong diagonal signal from the polymer effect. Akita demonstrated that sequence alone contains sufficient information to predict Hi-C contact maps with meaningful accuracy. The model correctly predicts TAD boundaries, capturing the enrichment of CTCF binding sites and transcription start sites at domain edges. In silico mutagenesis (systematically introducing mutations and observing predicted changes) reveals which sequence features most strongly influence predicted contacts, providing interpretable links between sequence and structure. The primary limitations are fixed resolution (2 kilobase bins), training on a single cell type (GM12878), and lack of explicit CTCF binding modeling.

**Orca** extended this approach through multi-scale architecture that predicts at multiple resolutions simultaneously [@zhou_orca_2022]. Rather than predicting directly at fine resolution, Orca first generates coarse predictions at megabase scale, then progressively refines to kilobase scale. This cascaded approach better captures the hierarchical nature of chromatin organization, improving compartment predictions while maintaining TAD and loop accuracy. Orca also introduced virtual 4C analysis: extracting the predicted contact profile from any genomic viewpoint, enabling focused analysis of specific loci without rerunning the model. The multi-scale training objective combines losses at different resolutions, allowing the model to learn both compartment-scale and loop-scale features from the same training data.

**C.Origami** addressed the cell-type specificity problem by incorporating CTCF ChIP-seq as auxiliary input [@tan_corigami_2023]. While Akita and Orca predict from sequence alone, C.Origami takes both sequence and CTCF binding profiles, enabling cell-type-specific predictions based on cell-type-specific CTCF patterns. This design reflects the loop extrusion model: TAD formation depends on where CTCF binds and in what orientation, and CTCF binding varies across cell types. The practical advantage is transfer learning: the model can be trained on cell types with expensive Hi-C data, then applied to cell types where only CTCF ChIP-seq is available (a much cheaper assay). C.Origami substantially outperforms sequence-only models for cross-cell-type prediction, though it requires CTCF data as input rather than predicting purely from sequence.

Other approaches explore different architectural and methodological choices. DeepC uses transfer learning to adapt models trained on one cell type to another, partially addressing the limited training data problem. Epiphany applies diffusion models to 3D structure prediction, treating contact matrix generation as a denoising process. Higashi addresses single-cell Hi-C data specifically, using variational autoencoders to impute missing contacts in the sparse single-cell matrices. Emerging transformer-based models may better capture the very long-range dependencies inherent in chromatin organization, though the computational cost of attention over megabase sequences presents challenges.

Interpretability analysis reveals what these models learn about sequence determinants of 3D structure. Attribution methods consistently identify CTCF motifs as the strongest predictors of contact patterns, with convergent CTCF pairs (motifs oriented toward each other) most strongly associated with loop anchors. Transcription start sites contribute to boundary predictions, consistent with the observation that active promoters often coincide with domain edges. GC content correlates with compartment identity (GC-rich regions tend toward A compartment), and repetitive element composition shows systematic associations (LINE elements with B compartment; Alu elements with A compartment). The orientation rule for CTCF emerges naturally from training: models learn that CTCF motif orientation, not just presence, predicts which sites will anchor loops. This learned relationship matches the mechanistic understanding from the loop extrusion model, providing validation that models capture biologically meaningful features.

Despite these advances, significant limitations remain. Resolution is constrained by training data; predicting nucleosome-level contacts requires Micro-C training data that exists for few cell types. The single-cell variation problem is fundamental: models trained on bulk Hi-C predict population averages, but gene regulation may depend on the stochastic 3D configurations in individual cells. Causality cannot be established from prediction alone; a model may correctly predict that two regions contact each other without revealing whether that contact causes any functional consequence. Generalization to cell types distant from training data remains uncertain, and the computational cost of processing megabase sequences limits practical applications for genome-wide analysis.


## 3D Structure and Gene Regulation {#sec-3d-regulation}

Enformer (@sec-regulatory) predicts gene expression from sequence within a 200 kilobase window, sufficient to capture many enhancer-promoter relationships but fundamentally limited by its treatment of the genome as a one-dimensional string. This representation cannot distinguish an enhancer that loops to a distant gene from one blocked by a TAD boundary, nor can it explain cell-type-specific contacts that activate different genes from the same enhancer in different contexts. The 3D genome provides this missing context: physical proximity through chromatin loops determines which regulatory elements can communicate.

Consider an enhancer located 300 kilobases from two genes, one upstream and one downstream. Linear models would predict similar regulatory influence on both genes based on comparable distances. But if a TAD boundary lies between the enhancer and the upstream gene, 3D structure predicts that only the downstream gene receives regulatory input. The boundary insulates the upstream gene from enhancer activity regardless of linear proximity. This insulation function explains why TAD boundaries show such strong evolutionary conservation: disrupting boundaries allows regulatory crosstalk that can dysregulate gene expression with pathogenic consequences.

The clinical significance is clearest in structural variant interpretation. Deletions that remove TAD boundaries cause enhancer hijacking, where regulatory elements gain access to genes in adjacent domains. The *EPHA4* locus provides the canonical example: limb enhancers normally activate *EPHA4* expression in developing limbs. When deletions remove the TAD boundary separating *EPHA4* from the adjacent *WNT6/PAX3* domain, these enhancers ectopically activate *WNT6*, causing limb malformations including brachydactyly and polydactyly. Different deletion sizes produce different phenotypes depending on which boundaries are removed and which new enhancer-gene contacts form. Similar mechanisms operate in cancer, where structural variants create novel enhancer-oncogene contacts that drive tumor growth. The diagnostic challenge is substantial: predicting pathogenicity of structural variants requires understanding which 3D contacts will be disrupted and what new contacts will form, predictions that sequence-only models cannot provide.

Integrating 3D predictions with expression models remains technically challenging. Hybrid approaches use predicted contacts to weight enhancer contributions: rather than treating all enhancers within a window equally, weights reflect predicted contact frequency with the target promoter. This activity-by-contact framework (expression proportional to the sum of enhancer activities weighted by contact frequencies) captures some of the regulatory logic that 1D models miss. Graph-based representations (@sec-networks) can encode genes and enhancers as nodes with contacts as edges, enabling graph neural networks to reason about regulatory relationships in 3D space. End-to-end training of combined 3D and expression models remains difficult; most current approaches train the components separately and combine predictions post hoc.

The causality question complicates interpretation. Do enhancer-promoter contacts cause gene activation, or does gene activation cause contacts? Transcription itself can influence chromatin organization: active transcription may stabilize enhancer-promoter contacts that would otherwise be transient. Perturbation experiments provide cleaner causal tests than correlational analysis. Acute degradation of cohesin eliminates TADs within hours, yet most genes show minimal expression changes, suggesting that many TAD structures are permissive rather than deterministic for gene regulation. CRISPR-based deletion of specific TAD boundaries similarly produces more modest effects than the structural disruption would suggest. The emerging view is nuanced: 3D structure constrains which enhancer-promoter interactions are possible, but whether those interactions occur depends on additional factors including transcription factor availability and chromatin state.


## Spatial Transcriptomics {#sec-spatial-transcriptomics}

Single-cell RNA sequencing (@sec-single-cell) reveals cellular heterogeneity but discards spatial information: we learn which genes each cell expresses but not where that cell sits within the tissue. For understanding tumor microenvironments, developmental gradients, or tissue architecture, spatial context is essential. A T cell adjacent to a tumor cell experiences a different microenvironment than one in the surrounding stroma, and this spatial context shapes gene expression programs in ways that dissociated single-cell data cannot capture.

Spatial transcriptomics technologies fall into two broad categories with complementary strengths. Spot-based methods like Visium (10x Genomics) capture polyadenylated RNA at arrayed positions on a slide, providing transcriptome-wide measurement at approximately 55 micrometer resolution (typically 1 to 10 cells per spot). These methods offer comprehensive gene coverage but limited spatial resolution. Imaging-based methods like MERFISH use sequential rounds of fluorescent hybridization to identify RNA molecules in situ, achieving subcellular resolution but limited to pre-selected gene panels (hundreds to thousands of genes rather than transcriptome-wide). Newer technologies like Stereo-seq achieve near-cellular resolution with transcriptome-wide coverage through spatial barcoding, though they remain less validated than established methods.

Computational challenges in spatial transcriptomics mirror and extend those in single-cell analysis. Spot deconvolution addresses the multiple-cells-per-spot problem in Visium data: inferring the cell type composition within each spot by comparing spot expression profiles to reference single-cell atlases. Imputation methods predict expression of genes not measured in imaging-based assays, leveraging correlations learned from reference datasets. Integration aligns spatial data with single-cell references, mapping reference cell types onto spatial coordinates. Domain correction handles batch effects that manifest in spatial patterns as well as expression levels. The sparsity problem is even more severe than in standard scRNA-seq; gene detection rates in spatial methods often fall below 10 percent.

Spatial foundation models remain much less mature than sequence-based models. The fundamental challenge is the lack of an equivalent to evolutionary pretraining: DNA and protein models learn from billions of years of evolutionary experiments encoded in sequence databases, but no comparable natural augmentation exists for spatial organization. Current approaches include graph neural networks that encode spatial relationships as edges between neighboring cells or spots, transformer architectures that treat spatial positions as tokens with positional encodings derived from coordinates, and generative models that learn spatial patterns from atlases of reference tissues. Models like Nicheformer apply transformer architectures to spatial niches (local cellular neighborhoods), learning representations that capture cell-cell communication patterns and tissue microenvironment signatures. SpaGCN uses graph convolutional networks with spatial graphs, propagating information between spatially adjacent regions to identify spatial domains with coherent expression patterns.

Other approaches address different aspects of the spatial modeling problem. CellPLM pretrains on millions of spatial transcriptomics cells, learning representations that transfer across tissue types and experimental platforms. STACI combines spatial coordinates with morphological features from histology images, enabling joint reasoning about molecular and visual tissue properties. GraphST uses graph attention networks to propagate expression signals across spatial neighborhoods while preserving local heterogeneity. These methods remain early in development compared to sequence foundation models; no spatial equivalent of DNABERT or ESM-2 has achieved broad adoption, and benchmark comparisons across methods remain limited by the diversity of spatial platforms and tissue types.

The clinical applications motivating spatial foundation model development center on tumor microenvironment characterization. The spatial organization of immune cells relative to tumor cells predicts treatment response: tumors with immune cells infiltrating the tumor core respond better to immunotherapy than those with immune exclusion at the tumor periphery. Spatial models aim to learn these prognostic patterns from training data, enabling prediction of treatment response from spatial organization alone. Similar applications exist in developmental biology (understanding morphogen gradients and cell fate decisions), neuroscience (mapping brain region organization), and pathology (characterizing disease architecture in tissue sections).


## Limitations and Open Questions {#sec-3d-limitations}

Current 3D genome and spatial models face limitations that constrain their utility for clinical and research applications. Resolution remains a fundamental constraint: most Hi-C prediction models operate at 2 to 10 kilobase resolution, while functionally relevant enhancer-promoter contacts involve specific sequences within those bins. Predicting which specific kilobases within a TAD contact each other requires resolution that exceeds current training data in most cell types. The resolution needed for accurate prediction may exceed the resolution achievable from bulk Hi-C, creating a data ceiling that computational methods cannot overcome.

The population averaging problem is more fundamental than a mere technical limitation. Bulk Hi-C measurements average over millions of cells, each with a different 3D configuration. Any two loci contact each other in only a minority of cells at any given time, yet the averaged contact frequency appears as a single value in the training data. Single-cell Hi-C reveals this heterogeneity but produces extremely sparse data (most possible contacts unmeasured in each cell). Models trained on population averages cannot predict single-cell behavior, yet gene regulation may depend on the stochastic dynamics of contact formation in individual cells. Whether the population average or the single-cell distribution matters more for predicting gene expression remains unclear.

Causality represents the deepest conceptual challenge. Predicting that two regions contact each other does not establish that the contact causes any biological consequence. Many TAD disruptions produce minimal expression changes; many enhancer-promoter contacts may be bystanders rather than drivers of transcription. The loop extrusion machinery that creates TADs operates continuously, but the transcriptional machinery that reads out enhancer-promoter communication operates on different timescales and with different requirements. Computational predictions of 3D structure are correlational; establishing which predicted contacts matter functionally requires experimental validation that computational methods cannot replace.

For clinical applications, the sparse training data creates systematic blind spots. Models trained on GM12878 and K562 may not transfer to the primary cells, developmental stages, or disease states where predictions matter most. A structural variant affecting 3D organization in neural progenitor cells cannot be reliably interpreted using models trained only on lymphoblastoid cells. The cell types most relevant for clinical interpretation are often those with the least 3D characterization data available.


## Structure as Context, Not Cause
The genome's three-dimensional organization provides context that one-dimensional sequence models cannot capture. Enhancer-promoter contacts explain regulatory relationships spanning hundreds of kilobases; TAD boundaries constrain which elements can interact; tissue architecture determines the cellular neighborhoods where gene expression programs execute. Models like Akita, Orca, and C.Origami demonstrate that sequence contains substantial information about chromatin folding, predicting contact maps from DNA sequence with accuracy sufficient to identify structural variants and disease-associated changes.

Yet the functional role of 3D structure remains more modest than early enthusiasm implied. Experimental perturbation studies show that TAD boundary disruption often has limited expression consequences. Many chromatin contacts appear permissive rather than instructive: they establish the possibility of regulatory communication without determining whether that communication occurs. A predicted enhancer-promoter contact indicates that interaction could happen, not that it does happen or that it matters when it does. The 3D genome may constrain the regulatory landscape without specifying regulatory outcomes.

This distinction shapes how 3D structure should be integrated with other modalities. Chromatin contacts become edges in gene regulatory networks (@sec-networks), providing structural priors for graph-based reasoning. Spatial expression patterns integrate with multi-omics approaches (@sec-multi-omics), adding tissue architecture alongside genomics and transcriptomics. For interpretability (@sec-interpretability), 3D structure offers mechanistic hypotheses that require experimental validation. Whether a predicted regulatory effect operates through chromatin proximity, or whether proximity merely correlates with regulation through shared causes, remains a question that computational models can motivate but not answer. The integration of 3D information into genomic AI proceeds with appropriate uncertainty about what that information contributes.
