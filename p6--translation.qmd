# Part VI: Clinical Translation {#sec-part6-intro}

The question shifts from how these models work to how they are used, and from what they can predict to what they enable us to do. This transition is not merely practical but conceptual: deploying a model in a clinical or industrial setting exposes assumptions that benchmarks leave implicit and reveals failure modes that curated evaluations obscure. A model achieving impressive metrics on held-out test sets may falter when deployed on populations underrepresented in training data, when integrated into workflows designed around different assumptions, or when its outputs must be communicated to clinicians and patients who lack the technical background to interpret confidence intervals. The gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility represents one of the most consequential challenges in genomic AI.

The preceding parts of this book traced genomic foundation models from their architectural foundations through the challenges of reliable evaluation. Part VI turns to practice, examining how these models are deployed in clinical risk prediction, rare disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and biological design. The discussion throughout emphasizes what changes when models leave the research setting: the calibration requirements become stricter, the fairness considerations become urgent, the interpretability demands become concrete, and the consequences of failure become measured in patient outcomes rather than leaderboard rankings.

Five chapters span the major application domains. @sec-clinical-risk examines clinical risk prediction, where foundation model features combine with electronic health records to stratify patients for disease, progression, and treatment response. @sec-rare-disease focuses on variant interpretation in rare disease, where models enter diagnostic pipelines alongside clinical geneticists and laboratory scientists. @sec-drug-discovery explores drug discovery, where genomic foundation models contribute to target identification, genetic validation, and biomarker development. @sec-design reverses the direction of inference from prediction to generation, examining how foundation models guide protein engineering, regulatory element design, and programmable biology. Finally, @sec-future addresses the regulatory, ethical, and frontier challenges that will shape how genomic AI moves from research to practice. The goal is not definitive protocols for each domain but a framework for reasoning about deployment: what questions to ask, what pitfalls to anticipate, and what principles should guide responsible development.
