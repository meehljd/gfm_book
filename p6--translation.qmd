# Part VI — Translation and Application {#sec-part6-intro}

The preceding parts of this book have traced the development of genomic foundation models from their architectural foundations through the challenges of reliable evaluation and interpretation. We have examined how convolutional networks learn sequence-to-function mappings, how transformers capture long-range dependencies and emergent representations, and how multi-omic integration extends these capabilities to systems-level biology. We have also confronted the reliability concerns that shadow this progress: confounders that inflate apparent performance, calibration failures that undermine clinical utility, and interpretability gaps that complicate mechanistic claims.

Part VI turns from methods to practice. The question shifts from how these models work to how they are used, and from what they can predict to what they enable us to do. This transition is not merely practical but conceptual: deploying a model in a clinical or industrial setting exposes assumptions that benchmarks leave implicit and reveals failure modes that curated evaluations obscure.

The five chapters in this part span the major application domains where genomic foundation models are reshaping practice. @sec-clinical examines clinical risk prediction, where foundation model features combine with electronic health records and traditional risk factors to stratify patients for disease, progression, and treatment response. The discussion emphasizes calibration, uncertainty quantification, and fairness considerations that are essential when predictions inform medical decisions and resource allocation. @sec-variants focuses on variant interpretation in rare disease and cancer, where models enter diagnostic pipelines alongside clinical geneticists and laboratory scientists, and where the stakes of misclassification are measured in missed diagnoses and inappropriate interventions. @sec-drugs explores drug discovery and biotechnology, where genomic foundation models contribute to target identification, genetic validation, biomarker development, and the broader industrial ecosystem that translates genetic insights into therapeutics. @sec-design reverses the direction of inference, moving from prediction to generation: how foundation models guide protein engineering, regulatory element design, and the emerging field of programmable biology. Finally, @sec-future steps back to consider open problems and responsible development, from technical challenges in generalization and robustness to ethical questions about equity, consent, and the governance of increasingly powerful genomic AI.

A thread running through these chapters is the gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility. Models that achieve impressive metrics on held-out test sets may falter when deployed on populations underrepresented in training data, when integrated into workflows designed around different assumptions, or when their outputs must be communicated to clinicians, patients, and regulators who lack the technical background to interpret confidence intervals and attribution scores. Closing this gap requires not only better models but also better infrastructure for validation, monitoring, and human oversight. It requires attending to the social and institutional contexts in which genomic predictions are produced and consumed.

The goal of Part VI is not to provide definitive protocols for each application domain, since such protocols would be obsolete before publication in a field moving this rapidly. Instead, the aim is to develop a framework for reasoning about deployment: what questions to ask when evaluating a model for clinical use, what pitfalls to anticipate when integrating foundation model outputs into existing pipelines, and what principles should guide responsible development as these tools become more powerful. Readers who have worked through the earlier parts of this book should be well positioned to engage critically with new applications as they emerge, recognizing both the genuine capabilities and the persistent limitations of genomic foundation models in practice.
