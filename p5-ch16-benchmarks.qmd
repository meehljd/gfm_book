# Benchmarks in Genomic Deep Learning {#sec-benchmarks}

## Chapter Overview
- Motivation: Why a survey chapter distinct from evaluation methodology?
- Relationship to @sec-eval: this chapter catalogs *what exists*; Ch17 covers *how to evaluate properly*
- A rapidly evolving landscape: benchmarks as snapshots of community priorities

## Molecular and Regulatory Benchmarks

### Chromatin and TF Binding Tasks
- DeepSEA evaluation sets: ENCODE/Roadmap chromatin profiles
- Basset and Basenji evaluation paradigms
- Nucleotide Transformer regulatory tasks
- Limitations: cell line bias, assay heterogeneity

### Splicing Benchmarks
- SpliceAI validation: GTEx RNA-seq, validation rates by delta score
- GENCODE splice junction sets
- Clinical splice variant databases
- Coverage gaps: deep intronic regions, tissue specificity

### Expression Prediction Tasks
- GTEx-based expression benchmarks
- Enformer evaluation: cross-gene, cross-individual splits
- Sei regulatory variant assessments
- Open questions: cell type coverage, dynamic range

## DNA Language Model Benchmark Suites

### BEND (Benchmark for DNA Language Models)
- Task composition: gene finding, enhancer annotation, chromatin accessibility, histone marks, CpG methylation
- Design philosophy: biologically meaningful tasks on human genome
- Key findings: limited long-range feature capture in current models

### Genomics Long-Range Benchmark (LRB)
- InstaDeep/Nucleotide Transformer evaluation suite
- Tasks requiring extended context: enhancer-promoter linking, expression prediction
- Fine-tuning recipes and their impact on evaluation
- Performance gaps: variant effect and expression prediction lag behind annotation tasks

### DNALongBench
- Five long-range tasks up to 1 Mb: enhancer-target gene, eQTL, 3D organization, regulatory activity, transcription initiation
- Baseline comparisons: CNN, HyenaDNA, Caduceus variants
- Designed for standardized long-range dependency assessment

### GenBench
- Modular framework for GFM evaluation
- Short-range vs long-range task stratification
- Architecture-task interactions: attention vs convolution preferences
- Reproducibility emphasis

## Protein Language Model Benchmarks

### ProteinGym
- 217 deep mutational scanning assays
- Standardized variant effect prediction evaluation
- Coverage of diverse protein families
- Spearman correlation as primary metric; limitations thereof

### Structure Prediction Benchmarks
- CASP legacy and ESMFold evaluation
- TM-score, GDT-TS metrics
- Single-sequence vs MSA-based evaluation

### Clinical Variant Benchmarks for Proteins
- ClinVar pathogenic vs benign discrimination
- Benchmarking AlphaMissense, ESM-1v, CADD integration
- Circularity concerns: training on clinical labels

## Variant Effect Prediction Benchmarks

### Clinical Annotation Databases
- ClinVar: composition, submission biases, version sensitivity
- HGMD limitations and access issues
- Expert-curated panels (ClinGen, disease-specific)
- Ancestry and gene coverage biases

### Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect (MAVEs)
- Deep mutational scanning: experimental ground truth
- MaveDB as a resource
- Assay-specific biases: reporter context, selection stringency
- Gene coverage gaps

### Noncoding Variant Benchmarks
- MPRA datasets for regulatory variants
- eQTL-based evaluation approaches
- GWAS fine-mapped variant sets
- Open challenges: linking molecular to trait effects

## Trait and Individual-Level Benchmarks

### TraitGym
- Complex trait prediction assessment
- Evaluation of GFM-augmented polygenic scores
- Ancestry stratification in evaluation

### Polygenic Score Benchmarks
- UK Biobank held-out evaluation
- Cross-biobank transferability
- Ancestry-specific performance gaps

## Clinical and Decision-Level Benchmarks

### Diagnostic Yield Studies
- Exome/genome sequencing cohort evaluations
- Retrospective re-analysis with newer models
- Prospective validation challenges

### Pharmacogenomic Benchmarks
- CPIC variant prediction tasks
- Drug response prediction evaluation

## Cross-Cutting Issues

### Benchmark Suite Proliferation
- Fragmentation and inconsistent evaluation
- Calls for unified evaluation frameworks
- Tension between standardization and task-specific validity

### What Benchmarks Miss
- Tasks underrepresented: structural variants, repeat regions, multi-variant effects
- Populations underrepresented: non-European ancestry
- Modalities underrepresented: long-read data, single-cell contexts
- Clinical endpoints vs molecular surrogates

### Benchmark Leakage and Staleness
- Training-test overlap across community benchmarks
- Temporal drift: benchmarks as moving targets
- Need for held-out evaluation consortia

## Chapter Summary
- Current benchmark landscape: strengths and systematic gaps
- Benchmark choice shapes model development incentives
- Forward link to @sec-eval: principles for using benchmarks critically
