Main decision point: keep this focused on RNA as a molecule (structure, sequence models, ncRNA) vs. the existing DNA→RNA prediction content in Ch 7/9. The cleanest split treats splicing as a DNA-sequence prediction problem (Ch 7) and RNA-seq/expression as a hybrid model output (Ch 9), while this new chapter covers models that operate on RNA sequences directly.

# RNA & Transcript-Level Models  {#sec-rna}

## Proposed Position
Part II, Chapter 8 (after Splicing, before Tokens chapter)

---

## Chapter Outline

### 8.1 Introduction: Why RNA Modeling Is Different
- RNA as molecule vs. transcript annotation
- Secondary structure as a first-class constraint
- The gap between DNA-centric models and RNA-specific biology

### 8.2 RNA Secondary Structure Prediction
- Classical approaches (thermodynamic folding, comparative)
- Deep learning methods (SPOT-RNA, etc.)
- Structure-aware attention mechanisms

### 8.3 RNA Foundation Models
- RNA-FM: self-supervised pretraining on 23M ncRNA sequences
- RNAErnie, RNA-MSM, and related models
- Downstream tasks: structure prediction, protein-RNA binding, expression regulation

### 8.4 Codon-Level Models
- cdsFM (EnCodon/DeCodon): synonymous codon context
- Life-Code: central dogma unification with codon tokenization
- Why protein LMs miss codon usage signals

### 8.5 mRNA Design & Optimization
- Codon optimization for expression
- UTR design for stability and translation efficiency
- Applications: vaccine design, mRNA therapeutics

### 8.6 Non-coding RNA Classification & Function
- lncRNA, miRNA, circRNA classification
- Target prediction for regulatory RNAs

### 8.7 Clinical Applications
- Splice-altering variant interpretation (cross-ref to Ch 7)
- RNA-based therapeutics target identification

## Overlap with Other Chapters

| Chapter | Overlap | Resolution |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Ch 7 (Splicing)** | SpliceAI, sQTL prediction, cryptic splice variants | Keep splice-site models in Ch 7; this chapter focuses on RNA as molecule/transcript, not pre-mRNA processing |
| **Ch 9 (Hybrid)** | Borzoi predicts RNA-seq coverage, splicing, polyA | Brief cross-reference; Borzoi stays in Ch 9 as a "sequence-to-transcriptome" hybrid model |
| **Ch 10 (DNA FMs)** | Some DNA LMs trained on transcripts | DNA chapter focuses on genomic DNA; RNA chapter covers RNA-specific pretraining |
| **Ch 14 (Multi-omics)** | RNA in multi-omic integration | Ch 14 covers cross-modal integration; this chapter covers RNA-specific foundation models |
