# The Genomic Data Landscape {#sec-data}

## Why Genomic Data Resources Matter

Once we can sequence genomes and call variants, we immediately face a new problem: interpretation. No single dataset is sufficient to decide whether a variant is benign, pathogenic, or relevant to a trait. Instead, we rely on a mosaic of complementary resources: reference genomes and gene annotations that define coordinates and consequences, population variation catalogs that reveal what survives in healthy individuals, cohort and biobank datasets that link variation to phenotypes, functional genomics atlases that map biochemical activity, and clinical databases that aggregate expert interpretations.

This chapter surveys these foundational resources. Later chapters draw from them repeatedly—either directly as model inputs or indirectly as labels, benchmarks, and priors. We begin with general genomic infrastructure (references, variation catalogs, cohorts) and then turn to functional and expression resources (ENCODE, GTEx-like datasets) that provide the training labels for sequence-to-function models.

## Reference Genomes and Gene Annotations

Every genomic analysis begins with a coordinate system. Reference genomes define the scaffold onto which sequencing reads are mapped, while gene annotations overlay that scaffold with biological meaning, specifying where transcripts begin and end, which regions encode protein, and how exons are spliced together. These resources are so foundational that their assumptions often become invisible: a variant's consequence, a gene's constraint score, and a model's training labels all depend on choices embedded in the reference assembly and annotation release. Understanding these dependencies is essential for interpreting results, recognizing systematic biases, and anticipating how analyses will generalize across datasets built on different genomic foundations.

### Reference Assemblies

Most modern pipelines align reads to a small number of reference assemblies, predominantly GRCh38 or the newer T2T-CHM13 [@nurk_complete_2022]. A reference genome is not simply a consensus sequence; it encodes a series of consequential decisions about how to represent duplications, alternate haplotypes, and unresolved gaps, all annotated with coordinates that downstream tools assume are stable.

The choice of reference shapes everything that follows. It determines which regions are "mappable" by short reads, how structural variants are represented, and how comparable results will be across cohorts and over time. Graph-based and pangenome references relax the assumption of a single linear reference, but the majority of datasets used in this book, and the models trained on them, are still built on GRCh37 or GRCh38 [@liao_pangenome_2023].

### Gene Models

Gene annotation databases such as GENCODE and RefSeq define the exon–intron structures, canonical and alternative transcripts, start and stop codons, and untranslated regions that allow us to interpret variants in biological context [@frankish_gencode_2019; @oleary_refseq_2016]. These annotations are critical for distinguishing coding from non-coding variants, identifying splice-disrupting mutations, and mapping functional genomics signals to genes. 

The MANE Select project provides a single matched transcript per protein-coding gene that is identical between GENCODE and RefSeq, simplifying clinical interpretation but further privileging a single isoform over biological complexity [@morales_mane_2022].

Many downstream resources, from variant effect predictors to polygenic score pipelines, implicitly assume that gene models are correct and complete. In practice, new isoforms continue to be discovered, alternative splicing remains incompletely cataloged, and cell-type-specific transcripts may be missing from bulk-derived annotations. These gaps propagate through every tool built on them.

## Population Variant Catalogs and Allele Frequencies

Population variant catalogs provide the empirical foundation for distinguishing pathogenic mutations from benign polymorphisms. Allele frequency, the proportion of chromosomes in a reference population carrying a given variant, serves as a powerful prior: variants observed at appreciable frequency in healthy individuals are unlikely to cause severe early-onset disease, while ultra-rare variants demand closer scrutiny. Beyond simple filtering, allele frequencies inform statistical frameworks for case-control association, provide training signal for deleteriousness predictors, and enable imputation of ungenotyped variants through [linkage disequilibrium](#glo-ld) The catalogs described below have progressively expanded in sample size, ancestral diversity, and annotation depth, transforming variant interpretation from an ad hoc exercise into a quantitative discipline.

### dbSNP and the Variant Universe

Historically, dbSNP aggregated known single nucleotide polymorphisms and short indels into a single catalog, providing stable identifiers (rsIDs) that serve as common currency across tools and publications, basic frequency information where available, and a convenient handle for linking to other resources [@sherry_dbsnp_2001]. Modern whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing cohorts routinely discover millions of previously unseen variants, but dbSNP identifiers remain the standard way to refer to known polymorphisms.

### 1000 Genomes and Early Reference Panels

The 1000 Genomes Project provided one of the first widely used multi-population reference panels, enabling imputation and linkage-disequilibrium-based analyses on genotyping arrays [@auton_1kgp_2015]. Its samples continue to serve as benchmarks for variant calling performance, and its haplotype structure underlies many imputation servers and downstream analyses [@yun_accurate_2021].

### The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)

The Genome Aggregation Database aggregates exome and genome data from a wide array of cohorts into harmonized allele frequency resources [@karczewski_gnomad_2020]. gnomAD provides high-resolution allele frequencies for SNVs and indels across diverse ancestries, constraint metrics such as pLI and LOEUF that summarize a gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variation, and per-variant annotations flagging poor quality regions, low complexity, and other caveats.

These resources are indispensable for filtering common variants in Mendelian disease diagnostics, distinguishing extremely rare variants from recurrent ones, and providing population genetics priors used by variant effect predictors and deleteriousness scores like CADD [@rentzsch_cadd_2019; @schubach_cadd_2024]. The constraint metrics, in particular, have become standard features in machine learning models that prioritize disease-relevant genes and variants.

## Cohorts, Biobanks, and GWAS Summary Data

Large-scale biobanks and population cohorts have transformed human genetics from a discipline reliant on family studies and candidate gene approaches into one powered by population-level statistical inference. These resources link genomic data to electronic health records, lifestyle questionnaires, imaging, and longitudinal outcomes, enabling discovery of genetic associations across thousands of traits simultaneously. However, the composition of these cohorts carries consequences: the overrepresentation of European-ancestry individuals in most major biobanks creates systematic gaps in variant discovery, effect size estimation, and polygenic score portability that propagate through downstream analyses. These ancestry biases, and strategies for addressing them, are discussed in detail in @sec-confound.

### Large Population Cohorts

Modern human genetics relies on large cohorts with genome-wide variation and rich phenotyping. UK Biobank, with approximately 500,000 participants and deep phenotyping, has become the dominant resource for methods development and benchmarking [@bycroft_ukbiobank_2018]. FinnGen leverages Finland's population history and unified healthcare records [@kurki_finngen_2023]. The All of Us Research Program prioritizes diversity, aiming to enroll one million participants with deliberate oversampling of historically underrepresented groups [@null_all-of-us_2019]. Additional resources include the Million Veteran Program, Mexican Biobank, BioBank Japan, China Kadoorie Biobank, and emerging African genomics initiatives such as H3Africa [@sirugo_diversity_2019]. Together, these efforts enable genome-wide association studies for thousands of traits, development and evaluation of polygenic scores, and fine-mapping of causal variants and genes [@marees_gwas_2018; @mountjoy_open_2021].

While this book focuses on models rather than specific cohorts, it is important to recognize that most GWAS and polygenic score methods in @sec-pgs assume data from either array genotyping with imputation or whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing with joint calling, as in DeepVariant/GLnexus-style pipelines [@yun_accurate_2021]. The ascertainment, quality control, and population composition of these cohorts shape what signals can be detected and how well models generalize.

### GWAS Summary Statistics

Beyond individual-level data, many resources distribute GWAS summary statistics: per-variant effect sizes and p-values aggregated across cohorts. The GWAS Catalog compiles published results across traits [@sollis_gwas-catalog_2023], while the PGS Catalog provides curated polygenic score weights and metadata for reproducibility [@lambert_pgs-catalog_2021]. Frameworks like Open Targets Genetics integrate fine-mapped signals and candidate causal genes across loci [@mountjoy_open_2021].

These summary data are the raw material for many polygenic score methods (@sec-pgs) and statistical fine-mapping algorithms. They enable meta-analysis across cohorts, transfer of genetic findings to new populations, and integration with functional annotations to prioritize causal variants.

## Functional Genomics and Regulatory Landscapes

The vast majority of the human genome lies outside protein-coding exons, yet this non-coding space harbors the regulatory logic that governs when, where, and how much each gene is expressed. Functional genomics assays provide the experimental means to map this regulatory landscape: identifying transcription factor binding sites, nucleosome positioning, chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, and three-dimensional genome organization across cell types and conditions. For the purposes of this book, these datasets serve a dual role. First, they supply the biological vocabulary for interpreting non-coding variants, linking sequence changes to potential regulatory consequences. Second, and more directly, they provide the training labels for sequence-to-function deep learning models. When a model learns to predict chromatin accessibility or histone marks from DNA sequence alone, it is learning a compressed representation of the regulatory code implicit in thousands of functional genomics experiments.

### ENCODE, Roadmap, and Related Consortia

Projects like ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) are primary data generation efforts that designed coordinated experimental campaigns, selected cell types and tissues for profiling, and produced comprehensive compendia of transcription factor ChIP-seq, histone modification ChIP-seq, open chromatin assays (DNase-seq, ATAC-seq), and chromatin conformation data (Hi-C and related methods) [@kagda_encode_2025; @kundaje_roadmap_2015; @edgar_geo_2002]. These datasets map regulatory elements, chromatin states, and higher-order genome structure with tight experimental control and uniform processing pipelines.

The significance of these consortia for this book is less about any individual experiment than about the scale and standardization they provide. By generating hundreds of assays across dozens of cell types with consistent protocols, ENCODE and Roadmap created canonical reference datasets that define the regulatory landscape for the cell types they profiled.

### The Cistrome Data Browser

While ENCODE and Roadmap produced authoritative datasets for their chosen cell types and factors, they represent only a fraction of publicly available functional genomics experiments. The Cistrome Data Browser addresses this gap by aggregating thousands of human and mouse ChIP-seq and chromatin accessibility datasets from ENCODE, Roadmap, GEO, and individual publications into a reprocessed, searchable repository [@zheng_cistrome_2019]. All datasets pass through a uniform quality control and processing pipeline, enabling comparisons across experiments that were originally generated by different labs with different protocols.

Cistrome provides uniform peak calls and signal tracks, metadata for cell type, factor, and experimental conditions, and tools for motif analysis and regulatory element annotation. The tradeoff is heterogeneity: while the reprocessing harmonizes computational steps, the underlying experiments vary in sample preparation, sequencing depth, and experimental design. Cistrome thus expands coverage at the cost of the tight experimental control found in the primary consortia.

### From Assays to Training Labels

Sequence-to-function models transform these functional genomics resources into supervised learning problems. Models like DeepSEA (see @sec-reg) draw training labels from ENCODE, Roadmap, and Cistrome-style datasets collectively: each genomic window is associated with binary or quantitative signals indicating transcription factor binding, histone modifications, or chromatin accessibility across many assays and cell types [@zhou_deepsea_2015; @zhou_expecto_2018].

The quality, coverage, and biases of these labels directly constrain what models can learn. Cell types absent from the training compendium cannot be predicted reliably. Factors with few high-quality ChIP-seq experiments will have noisier labels. And systematic differences between assay types (peak-based binary labels versus quantitative signal tracks) shape whether models learn to predict occupancy, accessibility, or something in between. These considerations become central when we examine model architectures and training strategies in @sec-reg.

## Expression and eQTL Resources

Expression datasets link sequence variation to transcriptional consequences, providing a bridge between regulatory elements and gene-level effects. While functional genomics assays reveal where transcription factors bind and which chromatin regions are accessible, expression data answer the downstream question: does this regulatory activity actually change how much RNA a gene produces? Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) formalize this relationship statistically, identifying genetic variants associated with changes in transcript abundance. For variant interpretation and genomic prediction, eQTLs offer mechanistic hypotheses connecting non-coding variants to specific genes and tissues. For model training, expression data provide quantitative labels that integrate across the many regulatory inputs converging on a single promoter. The resources below range from population-scale bulk tissue atlases to emerging single-cell datasets that resolve expression variation at cellular resolution.

### Bulk Expression Atlases

Projects like the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium provide RNA-seq expression profiles across dozens of tissues, eQTL maps linking variants to gene expression changes in cis, and splicing QTLs and other molecular QTLs [@gtex_2020]. With matched genotypes and expression data from nearly 1,000 post-mortem donors across 54 tissues, GTEx established foundational insights: most genes harbor tissue-specific eQTLs, regulatory variants typically act in cis over distances of hundreds of kilobases, and expression variation explains a meaningful fraction of complex trait heritability.

Even when not explicitly cited, GTEx-like resources underpin expression prediction models such as PrediXcan and TWAS frameworks, colocalization analyses that ask whether a GWAS signal and an eQTL share a causal variant, and expression-based prioritization of candidate genes at trait-associated loci [@gamazon_predixcan_2015; @gusev_twas_2016]. The GTEx design has limitations: post-mortem collection introduces agonal stress artifacts, sample sizes per tissue vary considerably, and some disease-relevant tissues (such as pancreatic islets or specific brain regions) remain undersampled. Complementary resources like the eQTLGen Consortium aggregate eQTL results from blood across larger sample sizes, trading tissue diversity for statistical power [@vosa_eqtl-gen_2021].

### Single-Cell and Context-Specific Expression

Bulk RNA-seq averages expression across all cells in a tissue sample, obscuring the cell-type-specific programs that often mediate disease biology. Single-cell RNA-seq resolves this heterogeneity, identifying expression signatures for individual cell types, rare populations, and transitional states. Large-scale efforts like the Human Cell Atlas, Tabula Sapiens, and disease-focused single-cell consortia are building reference atlases that catalog cell types across organs and developmental stages [@regev_cell-atlas_2017; @tabula_sapiens_2022].

For variant interpretation, single-cell data enable cell-type-specific eQTL mapping, revealing that a variant may influence expression in one cell type but not others within the same tissue. Spatial transcriptomics adds anatomical context, preserving tissue architecture while measuring gene expression. These technologies introduce computational challenges: sparsity from dropout, batch effects across samples and technologies, and the sheer scale of datasets with millions of cells. In this book, single-cell and spatial resources appear primarily in later chapters on multi-omics integration and systems-level models, but they represent the direction toward which expression genetics is moving, promising to connect genetic variation to cellular phenotypes with unprecedented resolution.

## Variant Interpretation Databases and Clinical Labels
Allele frequencies tell us what variants are tolerated in healthy populations, and functional genomics data reveal where the genome is biochemically active, but neither directly answers the clinical question: is this variant pathogenic? That determination requires integrating multiple lines of evidence, including family segregation, functional assays, computational predictions, and phenotypic observations, into a structured framework that can be applied consistently across variants, genes, and diseases. Clinical variant interpretation databases aggregate these assessments from laboratories, expert panels, and research groups, providing labels that inform diagnostic decisions, guide research, and serve as training data for machine learning models. These databases have become critical infrastructure for both clinical genomics and computational method development, though their labels carry biases and circularity that propagate through any analysis built on them.

### ClinVar and Related Resources
ClinVar aggregates assertions of variant pathogenicity from clinical laboratories and researchers, with supporting evidence and conflicting interpretations where relevant [@landrum_clinvar_2018]. Its labels are critical for diagnostic pipelines, benchmarking variant effect predictors, and training machine learning models in clinical genomics.

However, ClinVar's labels are not collected in isolation. As discussed in @sec-cadd, clinical submissions increasingly incorporate computational scores like CADD as one piece of evidence, which creates subtle circularity when those same labels are used to evaluate or train computational predictors [@schubach_cadd_2024]. This circularity is a recurring methodological concern throughout the book.

### ClinGen and Expert Curation
The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) complements ClinVar by providing expert-curated assessments at multiple levels of granularity [@rehm_clingen_2015]. ClinGen expert panels evaluate gene-disease validity, asking whether variation in a particular gene can cause a specific disease, and dosage sensitivity, determining whether haploinsufficiency or triplosensitivity leads to clinical phenotypes. These evaluations build on the catalog of Mendelian phenotypes maintained by OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), which provides curated gene-disease associations, clinical synopses, and literature summaries that have long served as the reference for clinical genetics [@amberger_omim_2015]. 

For individual variants, ClinGen Variant Curation Expert Panels apply the [ACMG/AMP criteria]() systematically, and the FDA has recognized these curations as a valid source of scientific evidence for clinical validity [@pejaver_calibration_2022]. ClinGen also develops calibrated thresholds for computational predictors like CADD and REVEL, specifying score intervals that justify different strengths of evidence for pathogenicity or benignity. These calibrated thresholds directly inform how computational scores should be incorporated into variant classification workflows.

### ClinPGx and Pharmacogenomics Resources
ClinPGx integrates the PharmGKB knowledge base, CPIC clinical guidelines, and PharmCAT annotation tool into a unified pharmacogenomics resource [@whirl-PharmGKB_2012]. While most variant interpretation databases focus on disease-causing mutations, ClinPGx curates gene-drug associations that influence drug metabolism, efficacy, and adverse reactions. These pharmacogenomic variants are often common polymorphisms rather than rare pathogenic mutations, but their clinical importance for prescribing decisions makes them a distinct category of actionable genetic variation. The CPIC guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for adjusting drug selection or dosing based on pharmacogene diplotypes, and ClinPGx-annotated FDA drug labels document the regulatory status of these associations.

## How Later Chapters Use These Resources

The genomic deep learning models that follow inherit both the strengths and limitations of the data they are trained on. @sec-pgs draws on GWAS summary statistics and biobank-scale cohorts to construct polygenic scores. @sec-cadd examines how annotation-based methods compress population frequencies, conservation, and functional signals into genome-wide deleteriousness scores. [Chapters @sec-reg]-[-@sec-splice] use ENCODE, Roadmap, and Cistrome-style functional data as training labels for sequence-to-function models, while [Chapters @sec-princ]-[-@sec-multi] revisit these resources as inputs, labels, and priors for genomic foundation models.

By surveying the data landscape in one place, we establish a common reference that later chapters can build on rather than re-introducing each resource from scratch. The recurring theme is that biases, gaps, and circularity in these foundational datasets propagate through every model trained on them. A variant effect predictor trained on ClinVar labels inherits the ascertainment biases of clinical sequencing; a chromatin model trained on ENCODE cell lines may not generalize to primary tissues. Understanding these foundations is essential for interpreting what models learn and anticipating where they will fail.
