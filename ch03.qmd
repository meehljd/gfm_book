# Establishing Genome-Wide Deleteriousness Scores (CADD)

## The Variant Prioritization Challenge

The human genome harbors millions of genetic variants, the vast majority of which have unknown functional consequences. While Chapter 1 addressed distinguishing true variants from sequencing artifacts and Chapter 2 examined statistical association with phenotypes, a complementary challenge remains: predicting which variants are likely deleterious across the entire genome, including both coding and non-coding regions.

Traditional approaches to variant prioritization suffer from critical limitations:

- **Single-feature scores**: Most methods exploit a single information type (e.g., conservation) and cannot integrate diverse signals
- **Restricted scope**: Many tools focus exclusively on missense variants or specific genomic contexts
- **Training set bias**: Supervised methods trained on ClinVar or HGMD pathogenic variants inherit biases toward well-studied genes and variant types

Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) addresses these limitations through a fundamentally different approach: rather than training directly on known pathogenic variants, CADD learns to distinguish variants that survived evolutionary selection from those that did not [@rentzsch_cadd_2019].

## The Evolutionary Proxy Training Strategy

CADD's innovation lies in its training data construction. Rather than relying on curated pathogenic/benign labels—which are sparse, biased, and incomplete—CADD exploits evolutionary history as a proxy for deleteriousness.

### Proxy-Neutral Variants

The proxy-neutral training set consists of approximately 15 million SNVs and 1.8 million indels that are:

- **Human-derived**: Present in modern humans but absent in the inferred human-ape ancestor genome
- **Fixed or nearly fixed**: Allele frequency of 95–100% in human populations

These variants have persisted through millions of years of purifying selection since the human-chimpanzee divergence. By virtue of reaching fixation, they are overwhelmingly neutral or at most weakly deleterious—strong deleterious effects would have been purged by natural selection.

### Proxy-Deleterious Variants

The proxy-deleterious set is generated through simulation, matching the sequence composition, substitution frequencies, and local mutation rate patterns of the proxy-neutral variants. These simulated "de novo" variants are free from selective pressure—they represent the full spectrum of possible mutations, including those that would be deleterious in a real genome.

While many simulated variants are indeed neutral, an unknown but substantial fraction would be harmful if they occurred in an individual. The key insight is that the *relative enrichment* of deleterious variants differs systematically between the two sets: proxy-neutral variants are depleted for deleterious alleles, while proxy-deleterious variants contain a representative sample.

### Training Objective

A machine learning classifier trained to distinguish proxy-neutral from proxy-deleterious variants effectively learns which annotation features characterize variants likely to be "observed" (survived selection) versus "simulated" (potentially deleterious). Higher CADD scores indicate variants more similar to the simulated set—and thus more likely to have functional consequences.

This approach provides several advantages over pathogenicity-based training:

| Aspect | CADD Approach | Pathogenicity Training |
|--------|---------------|------------------------|
| Training set size | ~30 million variants | Thousands of variants |
| Genome coverage | All regions equally | Biased toward coding |
| Gene bias | Minimal | Concentrated in disease genes |
| Variant type bias | Minimal | Biased toward missense |

## Integration of Diverse Annotations

CADD's strength derives from integrating more than 60 distinct genomic annotations into a unified framework. These annotations span multiple categories:

### Gene Model Annotations

Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) provides consequence predictions including:

- Transcript location (exon, intron, UTR, intergenic)
- Protein-coding effects (synonymous, missense, nonsense, frameshift)
- Distance to splice sites and transcript features
- Amino acid properties for missense variants

### Conservation and Constraint

Multiple evolutionary conservation scores capture selective pressure across different timescales:

- **PhyloP**: Position-specific conservation across 46 vertebrate species
- **PhastCons**: Probability of negative selection estimated from multiple alignments
- **GERP++**: Rejected substitution scores indicating purifying selection
- **GerpN/GerpS**: Neutral evolution and constrained element scores

### Epigenetic and Regulatory Activity

Data from ENCODE and NIH Roadmap Epigenomics provide chromatin state information:

- DNase I hypersensitivity
- Histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, etc.)
- Transcription factor binding sites
- Chromatin accessibility across cell types

### Additional Features

- CpG dinucleotide context and mutation rates
- Sequence properties (GC content, repeat regions)
- Population genetics metrics (allele frequency distributions)
- Protein domain annotations

## Model Architecture and Scoring

### Machine Learning Framework

CADD v1.0 employed a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. Subsequent versions transitioned to logistic regression, which provides:

- Faster training and inference
- Interpretable feature weights
- Efficient handling of crossed features

To capture non-linear relationships between annotations, CADD creates crossed feature annotations—for example, combining conservation scores with consequence labels to allow the model to weight conservation differently for missense versus synonymous variants.

### PHRED-Scaled Scores

Raw CADD scores are difficult to interpret across genomic contexts. To enable meaningful comparisons, CADD transforms raw scores into PHRED-like scaled scores based on genome-wide rank:

$$\text{CADD}_\text{PHRED} = -10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{rank}}{N}\right)$$

where $N$ ≈ 9 billion represents all possible single nucleotide substitutions in the reference genome. A CADD score of 10 indicates the variant is in the top 10% most deleterious; a score of 20 indicates the top 1%; a score of 30 indicates the top 0.1%.

This scaling provides intuitive interpretation: CADD 15–20 typically indicates likely functional variants, while CADD > 30 suggests strong deleteriousness.

## CADD v1.7: Integration of Deep Learning Predictions

The most recent CADD release (v1.7) demonstrates how the annotation integration framework can incorporate predictions from deep learning models [@schubach_cadd_2024]. This represents a bridge between traditional annotation-based approaches and the sequence-to-function models covered in subsequent chapters.

### Protein Language Model Features

CADD v1.7 incorporates scores from Meta ESM-1v, a protein language model trained on millions of protein sequences. ESM-1v provides:

- Per-residue fitness predictions based on evolutionary plausibility
- Improved missense variant prioritization
- Context-aware amino acid substitution scoring

These features substantially improve CADD's performance on coding variants, particularly for missense mutations in conserved protein regions.

### Regulatory CNN Predictions

For non-coding variants, CADD v1.7 integrates predictions from a custom convolutional neural network trained on regions of open chromatin. This model:

- Predicts regulatory activity from DNA sequence
- Provides variant effect scores for regulatory elements
- Captures sequence patterns associated with transcription factor binding

### Extended Conservation Scores

The Zoonomia project's alignment of >240 mammalian genomes provides deeper evolutionary context through:

- Broader phylogenetic sampling
- Improved resolution of constrained elements
- Better detection of lineage-specific selection

### Performance Improvements

Evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates consistent gains:

| Benchmark | CADD v1.6 | CADD v1.7 | Improvement |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| ClinVar pathogenic vs. common | 0.94 | 0.95 | +1% |
| Deep mutational scanning (31 datasets) | 0.78 | 0.81 | +3% |
| Regulatory saturation mutagenesis | 0.68 | 0.72 | +4% |

The regulatory variant improvements are particularly notable, as this has historically been CADD's weakest domain.

## Benchmarking Against Alternative Approaches

CADD's genome-wide applicability allows direct comparison with specialized scores:

### Coding Variants

For missense variant classification separating ClinVar pathogenic from high-frequency ExAC variants, CADD performs comparably to dedicated tools like PolyPhen-2 and PROVEAN while maintaining broader applicability. The integration of ESM-1v features in v1.7 further improves coding variant prediction.

### Non-coding Variants

CADD demonstrates strong performance on regulatory variants, though recent benchmarks suggest functional-genomics-supervised models like Enformer and Borzoi may perform better for certain variant classes. Interestingly, alignment-based models including CADD and GPN-MSA compare favorably for Mendelian and complex disease traits, while expression-predicting models excel for complex non-disease traits [@benegas_traitgym_2025].

### Population Frequency Correlation

A key validation of CADD's evolutionary proxy approach is the strong inverse correlation between CADD scores and population allele frequency. Higher-scoring variants are systematically rarer in population databases like gnomAD, consistent with purifying selection removing deleterious alleles—the same principle underlying the training strategy.

## Significance for Genomic Deep Learning

CADD established several important paradigms that inform the deep learning approaches covered in subsequent chapters:

1. **Annotation integration**: The principle of combining multiple information sources into unified predictions extends naturally to multi-headed neural network architectures that jointly predict diverse genomic features.

2. **Evolutionary training signals**: Using evolutionary conservation as a proxy for function—rather than curated pathogenicity labels—avoids biases and provides genome-wide coverage. This approach reappears in protein language models and genomic foundation models.

3. **Genome-wide applicability**: CADD demonstrated that a single framework could score any variant anywhere in the genome, setting expectations for the comprehensive coverage that sequence-to-function models now achieve.

4. **Continuous improvement through feature addition**: The progression from CADD v1.0 to v1.7 shows how deep learning predictions can be incorporated as features into existing frameworks, providing a practical integration path.

The chapters that follow trace how deep learning models moved from providing features to CADD-like integrators toward directly predicting variant effects from DNA sequence—learning the regulatory grammar that explains *why* evolutionary conservation patterns emerge.
