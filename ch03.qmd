# Foundational Functional Genomics Data

## Data Sources

- The ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects are fundamental public data resources providing annotations for functional regulatory elements, such as:
  - Histone marks (HMs)
  - Transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)
  - DNA accessibility (DNase I hypersensitive sites)

## Role in Model Training

- These data serve as the crucial molecular phenotype targets used to train supervised Sequence-to-Function models (like DeepSEA and its successors) that interpret non-coding sequence variation.
