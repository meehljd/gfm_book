# Integrating Multi-omics and Systems Context

## Epigenomic Foundation Models (CpGPT)

- CpGPT (Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine Pretrained Transformer):
  - Specialized foundation model for DNA methylation.
  - Leverages embeddings from nucleotide LMs (like NTv2) and positional context.
  - Trained on the massive CpGCorpus dataset (>150,000 samples).
  - Achieves SOTA performance in clinically relevant tasks:
    - Mortality risk assessment.
    - Cancer classification.

## Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Subtyping

- GNNs are powerful for modeling non-linear biological relationships and integrating heterogeneous data.

Examples:

- **MoGCN (Multi-Omics Graph Convolutional Network)**:
  - Designed for interpretable cancer subtype analysis.
  - Uses GCN to extract significant features from multi-omics data for clinical diagnosis.
- **CGMega**:
  - Explainable GNN framework using graph attention.
  - Integrates multi-omics data:
    - Genomics
    - Epigenomics
    - 3D genome architecture
    - Protein–protein interactions (PPIs)
  - Identifies influential cancer gene modules.

## Interpreting Rare and Complex Variants

- **DeepRVAT (Deep Rare Variant Association Testing)**:
  - Uses a deep set network to learn a single, trait-agnostic gene impairment score from dozens of rare variant annotations.
  - Score is efficient and generalizable across traits.
  - Facilitates refinement of Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) by accounting for rare variant effects.
- **NeEDL (Epistasis)**:
  - Uses network medicine to inform selection of higher-order interactions (Epistatic Interactions, EIs) between multiple SNPs.
  - Goes beyond pair-wise limits.
  - Addresses the polygenic nature of most heritable diseases.
- **G2PT (Genotype-Phenotype Transformer)**:
  - Graph transformer designed for transparent genotype-to-phenotype translation.
  - Incorporates hierarchical biological knowledge.
  - Enables analysis of nonlinear gene-by-gene epistatic interactions underlying polygenic risk prediction.
